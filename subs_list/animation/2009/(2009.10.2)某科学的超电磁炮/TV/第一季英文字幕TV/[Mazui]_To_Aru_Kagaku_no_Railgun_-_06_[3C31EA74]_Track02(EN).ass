Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.74,0:03:33.00,main,,0000,0000,0000,,So that's why you're at a dead end.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.00,0:03:37.22,main,,0000,0000,0000,,And I doubt there's any problem with the databanks either.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.10,0:03:38.91,main,,0000,0000,0000,,Could it be...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:39.16,0:03:42.94,main,,0000,0000,0000,,the work of an esper who isn't registered yet?
