Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.76,0:00:28.29,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Thanks to their devotion to this, Orsola is safe for now.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.71,0:00:29.42,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:30.23,0:00:33.97,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,We will serve as a decoy and attack Amakusa from the front.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.94,0:03:24.89,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:24.89,0:03:29.40,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Do you really think we can do all that before time runs out?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.19,0:03:32.34,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Honestly, it'll be tough.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.05,0:03:38.07,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Actually, there is something I didn't tell the Roman Catholics.

Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.11,0:04:00.24,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,So don't think that everything will go according to plan.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:00.67,0:04:01.43,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Then...
Dialogue: 0,0:04:02.81,0:04:05.43,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Then we should make Orsola our top priority, right?

Dialogue: 0,0:05:21.09,0:05:23.55,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,In the end, I'm the decoy?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.19,0:05:45.10,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Why did Stiyl give me this?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.57,0:06:21.57,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Are Index and Stiyl okay?

Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.99,0:06:53.18,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm here to save you, of course.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.86,0:06:59.50,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,You really came here to save a complete stranger?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.50,0:07:00.44,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:01.13,0:07:03.48,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,You're not here for {\i1}The Book of Law{\i0}?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:03.48,0:07:06.07,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I don't care about that stuff.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.07,0:07:11.95,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Anyway, do I really look so curious that I'd go through all this for some old book?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.92,0:07:16.28,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,In that case, you have my thanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:17.34,0:07:20.04,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,By the way, what are you doing here?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:22.16,0:07:26.84,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I was able to escape during the commotion, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:36.54,0:07:38.29,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Thank you.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:38.29,0:07:40.64,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,But how did you do it?
Dialogue: 0,0:07:42.51,0:07:45.98,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I just happen to have an ability like this.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:46.50,0:07:49.53,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's complicated, so I won't bother trying to explain.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:53.07,0:07:54.65,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,They can't have gotten far.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.65,0:07:55.20,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Search!
Dialogue: 0,0:08:01.02,0:08:02.70,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,They're looking for you.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.18,0:08:09.73,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I heard the Special Movement Method can be only used at 12:05 AM.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.73,0:08:12.27,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,In that case, we can just wait here until then.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:21.94,0:08:22.60,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Y-Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.98,0:08:27.48,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,By the way, do you have anything to do with the Roman Catholics?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:28.69,0:08:32.07,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Well, I know some people from the Anglican Church.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:32.07,0:08:38.44,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,In other words, you're helping the Anglican Church, not the Roman Catholics?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.12,0:08:40.70,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,No, it's not like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:44.49,0:08:46.42,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,So that's how it is.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.89,0:08:54.74,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's obvious that it's best for someone like you that you aren't involved in the world of the Church.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.69,0:09:00.40,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Though I suppose it can't be helped if I have this.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.58,0:09:04.77,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Did someone from the Anglican Church give you that?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:05.09,0:09:05.71,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:06.24,0:09:08.14,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,You can have it if you want.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:08.55,0:09:10.02,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not worth anything to me.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:10.94,0:09:12.79,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Is it really alright?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:13.42,0:09:14.17,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:16.32,0:09:18.60,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,May I ask a favour of you?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.60,0:09:19.24,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,What?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:19.82,0:09:23.75,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Could you fasten the pendant around my neck with your own hands?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.01,0:09:27.42,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I don't mind, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:40.20,0:09:41.85,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,What's the matter?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:42.78,0:09:44.29,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Nothing.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.30,0:10:06.87,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,In any case, I heard you can read {\i1}The Book of Law{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:08.04,0:10:11.86,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's not exactly reading. Rather, it's a way of decoding it.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.71,0:10:14.88,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,No, no.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.23,0:10:18.34,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I'm just curious about why you wanted to study {\i1}The Book of Law{\i0}.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.94,0:10:20.56,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Isn't it kind of dangerous?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.07,0:10:24.96,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Because I wanted power.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.96,0:10:27.60,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I can say that without a doubt.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:28.23,0:10:32.46,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,The power of a magical grimoire cannot bring happiness to anyone.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:33.00,0:10:36.99,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,To the contrary, it only brings conflict.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.01,0:10:45.70,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,The reason I study magical grimoires is in order to destroy the originals.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:52.81,0:10:53.62,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Stiyl!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:55.55,0:10:57.21,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,What are you doing?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.21,0:10:59.43,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Hurry and escape!
Dialogue: 0,0:11:03.56,0:11:05.88,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,What are you up to?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.88,0:11:08.30,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,A friend from the Anglican Church?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.62,0:11:12.47,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Hey, where's the pride of a gentleman from the empire?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.81,0:11:16.63,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Show me, Tatemiya Saiji, some of it.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:23.35,0:11:24.83,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,You can't do it.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.83,0:11:28.62,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,You can't even protect a single woman.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:36.06,0:11:38.59,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,You were protecting Index...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:38.59,0:11:40.17,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Don't waste your breath.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:41.09,0:11:43.96,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,So you found Orsola Aquinas.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.96,0:11:48.18,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,As usual, I can't tell if this bad luck of yours is a blessing or a curse.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:49.05,0:11:51.56,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I've already explained this.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:52.24,0:11:57.02,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Orsola Aquinas, we don't intend to harm you.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:57.72,0:12:02.45,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It's true that your words were full of hope.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:03.20,0:12:08.84,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,But, I don't believe in peace that is wielded as a weapon.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:09.56,0:12:11.64,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Too bad.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:11.64,0:12:15.04,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It won't help even if you return to the Roman Catholics.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.30,0:12:19.56,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,Unarmed?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.81,0:12:23.09,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,That sword, did you get it from Uragami?
Dialogue: 0,0:12:24.71,0:12:26.14,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,If you mean the girl, she's lying over there.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:27.21,0:12:30.00,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,I protected the back of her head, so she won't die.
Dialogue: 0,0:12:30.45,0:12:33.10,Index II main,,0000,0000,0000,,It doesn't matter if she lives or not.
