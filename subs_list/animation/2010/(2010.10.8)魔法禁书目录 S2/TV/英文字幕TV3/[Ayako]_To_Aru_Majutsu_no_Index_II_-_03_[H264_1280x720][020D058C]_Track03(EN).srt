1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,980
We have found the main unit of the Amakusa in the Parallel Sweets Park. {marsd note: we use BrE and correct names orz}

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,070
However, we were unable to locate both "Liber AL vel Legis" and Orsola.

3
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,530
Could it be that Orsola was already...

4
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,660
The Amakusa's main objective is to acquire the cipher for "Liber AL vel Legis" from Orsola.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,580
We can assume that she is safe as long as they desire "Liber AL vel Legis."

6
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,420
I see...

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,970
We will set up a decoy and fight the Amakusa head on.

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,590
While we are doing so, you guys will search within the park.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,740
If you find "Liber AL vel Legis" and Orsola, capture them.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,150
If you don't destroy the vortex used for Special Movement Method, they might escape with Orsola.

11
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,890
Although we can't destroy the vortex itself until it opens at midnight...

12
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,570
The period of time the vortex is active is only five minutes, right?

13
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,070
Right.

14
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:03,200
Please evacuate if you fail to secure them before five past midnight.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,040
We will conduct the search in the park by ourselves once we neutralise the Amakusa.

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,130
Searching for "Liber AL vel Legis" and Orsola, then destroying the vortex...

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,960
We have quite a tight schedule it seems.

18
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,050
This is unforgivable, isn't it?

19
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:38,900
Christianity was spread with the original intention to bring salvation to all.

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:44,450
But to take advantage and abuse its power for this...

21
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:22,220
<b>Amakusa</b>

22
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,810
Hey Stiyl.

23
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,810
What?

24
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:30,020
Do you really think you can finish all the tasks before the time limit?

25
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,400
To be honest, it really is quite difficult.

26
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,070
There is actually one piece of information I have not told the Roman Catholics.

27
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,860
Huh?

28
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,360
Kanzaki Kaori, who was supposed to be in England, has gone missing.

29
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,870
She has?

30
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,660
She's most likely acting for her former subordinates,

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,170
or should I say, her comrades.

32
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,790
If we try to inflict devastating damage to the Amakusa,

33
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,290
that Saint may very well attack us.

34
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,470
That's why you must not think of completing every task.

35
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,550
Then...

36
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,430
Then can we make Orsola our top priority?

37
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,810
That's fine.

38
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,410
"Liber AL vel Legis" is nothing but a needless treasure without the cipher.

39
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,150
I think that's fine too.

40
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,860
I know you'll end up doing things your own way no matter what we say.

41
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,990
Since we're already limited in numbers, it's better for us to come together and cooperate.

42
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,660
I got it.

43
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,570
Thanks.

44
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,170
Don't say something so discouraging and disgusting before a big battle.

45
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,080
The diversion operation has begun.

46
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,210
Let's go!

47
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,050
Duck!

48
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,690
Kamijou Touma,

49
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,310
I'll give this to you.

50
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,020
This is?

51
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,950
If you don't want to die, you should always keep it with you!

52
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,910
Touma!

53
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,050
Stiyl, Index!

54
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,170
Hey...

55
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:20,040
Couldn't we at least decide on some signal before you escape?!

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,920
I was used as a decoy yet again?

57
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,070
Why did Stiyl give this to me?

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,650
I wonder if Index and Stiyl will be okay...

59
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,190
Just where is Orsola?

60
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,960
Orsola?

61
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,620
Phew...

62
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,420
You must be the person I met at the bus stop.

63
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,760
Why are you in a dangerous place like this?

64
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,180
I came to rescue you, of course.

65
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,560
Uhh... Are you really here to rescue a complete stranger like me?

66
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,450
Yeah.

67
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:03,480
Even though you don't have any involvement with "Liber AL vel Legis"?

68
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,200
I don't care about this stuff.

69
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,070
Do I look like a maniac who'd come all the way for some old book?

70
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,740
Then...

71
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,370
I thank you very much.

72
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,290
That aside, what are you doing here?

73
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,600
Well...

74
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:26,830
I was able to slip away in the chaos.

75
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,510
I see.

76
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,100
Thank you,

77
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,770
but how did you do that?

78
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,960
Well... My only ability is to do this sort of stuff.

79
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,660
It gets really complicated, so I won't give any weird explanation.

80
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,620
They couldn't have gotten very far.

81
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,200
Keep searching!

82
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,840
They must be searching for you.

83
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,380
I heard they can only use the Special Movement Method up to five minutes past midnight.

84
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,340
We can probably continue hiding here until then.

85
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,470
Oh dear...

86
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,980
You might catch a summer cold like this.

87
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,810
Right...

88
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,520
By the way, are you in any way involved with the Roman Catholics?

89
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,900
Well... I do know someone from the Anglican Church.

90
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:38,450
That means you have a family relation with the Anglican Church and not the Roman Catholics?

91
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,710
No, it's nothing like that.

92
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,670
You're right.

93
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:55,180
It's better for someone like you to not be involved with our church world.

94
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:56,470
Hmmm...

95
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,600
Well, there's no use for me to have something like this.

96
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,520
Oh my!

97
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,760
Did your friend from the Anglican church give this to you? {fixt!}

98
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,110
Yeah.

99
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,020
Would you take care of it for me since I don't know its value?

100
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,160
Is it really okay?

101
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,320
Yeah.

102
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,620
I just have one wish!

103
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,240
Wh-What is it?

104
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,740
Would you please put the necklace around my neck for me?

105
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,420
I... I don't mind...

106
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,800
What's wrong?

107
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,440
N-Nothing.

108
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,830
By the way, do you know how to read "Liber AL vel Legis" or something?

109
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,800
It's more of how to decipher a code rather than how to read it.

110
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,050
Don't get me wrong...

111
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,340
I was just wondering why you were researching it.

112
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,720
I heard it's a dangerous book, after all.

113
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,770
Because I wanted power.

114
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,620
I can say that without a doubt...

115
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,820
The power of magic books cannot bring happiness to anyone.

116
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,120
There has been nothing but fighting because of these books.

117
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:45,700
That's why I wanted to research how that magic book functioned in order to destroy it.

118
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,720
Stiyl!

119
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,210
What are you doing?

120
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,420
Hurry up and escape!

121
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,810
What are you doing...

122
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,850
My brother from the Anglican Church?

123
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,690
Hey dude, where's your pride as an English gentleman?

124
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,700
Show me, Tatemiya Saiji, some of that pride.

125
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,870
If you bought this you were ripped off.

126
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,820
This won't do.

127
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,570
You can't even protect a single woman like this.

128
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,460
You were fighting while protecting Index?

129
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,170
Concentrate on the critical issue!

130
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,720
You have custody of Orsola Aquinas?

131
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,180
I can never tell if you're really lucky or not.

132
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:51,560
I've explained to you many times before...

133
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,020
That we have no intentions to harm you, Orsola Aquinas.

134
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,460
Indeed, I understand that your words were filled with hope.

135
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:08,830
However, I do not believe in peace achieved by a show of force.

136
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,410
Pity.

137
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,040
It's meaningless to return to the Roman Catholics.

138
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,430
Heh, you're unarmed?

139
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,840
That sword...

140
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,720
Did you take it from Uragami?

141
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,130
Your subordinate is sleeping over there.

142
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,610
I've prevented her from hitting her head, so she's not dead.

143
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,110
It doesn't mean it's okay even if she's not dead.

144
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,230
Are you dissing me or something?

145
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,360
If you're a person who would fight for someone else,

146
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,820
would you please put away your sword?

147
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,170
I'd rather not fight against someone like you.

148
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,710
I really hope so.

149
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,450
Our enemy is the Roman Catholics, if you're in any way related to them,

150
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:58,000
we cannot let you go even if you're from the Anglican Church.

151
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,960
Quit the nonsense, bastard!

152
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,720
I'll feel terrible if you stare at me with eyes like that.

153
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,010
But you see,

154
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,630
If you say we fight, then let's fight!

155
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,640
Today will be the last day of your life!

156
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,320
He disappeared?

157
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh?

158
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,160
Magic?

159
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,680
Then-

160
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,910
No!

161
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,990
It's not, Touma! It's not magic-

162
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,490
Don't come, Index!

163
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,160
The flame of the Origin.

164
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,710
The purpose for your light -

165
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,710
To become a sword to defend the gentle warmth and deliver harsh judgement!

166
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,800
He moved?

167
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,310
It must be magic after all!

168
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,220
Touma!

169
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,350
Do it...

170
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,860
Stab it through me, Stiyl!

171
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:10,540
I've already cast a basic anti-physical spell on myself.

172
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,870
The only thing I have to worry about is that flame sword.

173
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,210
I will quickly erect a barrier...

174
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,200
Phew...

175
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,120
Touma, Touma! Are you all right?

176
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,790
You're not injured, are you?

177
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,420
Does it hurt anywhere?

178
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,910
Oh, nothing ser-

179
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,080
Are you sure? Are you sure you're all right?

180
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,420
I'm fine.

181
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,220
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

182
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:11,800
Really?

183
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,600
I'm relieved. Since...

184
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,240
Huh?

185
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,610
Now I can bite all I want on your head!

186
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,530
Who did you think you are, Touma?

187
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,400
I got it!
Who did you think you are, Touma?

188
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,280
I, Kamijou Touma, realise that I have only myself to blame this time!
How could you go fight a real magician?

189
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:30,910
How could you go fight a real magician?

190
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,580
Touma really is an idiot!

191
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,360
Reckless.

192
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,500
Uhhh... Index-san?

193
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,250
It's quiet, isn't it?

194
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,880
It doesn't look as if there were that many people wreaking havoc.

195
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,170
It's true.

196
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,520
Hey.

197
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,710
Sorry, but won't you release me here?

198
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,360
I can't just leave her like this.

199
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,640
Huh?

200
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,740
What are you talking about?

201
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:05,610
I hope you do know the treatment that she is going to receive?

202
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,610
Huh?

203
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,450
No Touma, don't listen to him.

204
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,520
He's using his words as a weapon.

205
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:14,410
She will be killed.

206
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,830
Listen, do not hand her over to the Roman Catholics.

207
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,120
The Roman Catholics' real purpose is to kill her.

208
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,880
It was you people who kidnapped Orsola.

209
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,640
It was also you people who stole "Liber AL vel Legis".

210
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:31,580
We did not steal any "Liber AL vel Legis".

211
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
If we were to use the power of "Liber AL vel Legis",

212
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,140
the world under Christianity rule would end on that day.

213
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:48,220
Do you think that we, the Amakusa who specialise in elusion, would want to get hold of such power?

214
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,110
Same goes for the Roman Catholics.

215
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:57,580
Do you believe that they, being the largest faction of the Christians, would wish to bring an end of Christian rule.

216
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,790
They decided to sercretly eliminate Orsola.

217
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,250
She sensed that and came to us for help.

218
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:13,760
In short, it was just a ruse by the Roman Catholics that the "Liber AL vel Legis" was stolen.

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,930
No, I can't.

220
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,840
I can't belive you yet.

221
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,360
Why not?

222
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,470
If what you said was all true,

223
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:24,690
why did Orsola escape from you?

224
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,320
It's the same...

225
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,740
The same?

226
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,200
In the end, she couldn't fully trust us, just like you couldn't.

227
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,450
She thought that we would ask for the cipher for "Liber AL vel Legis".

228
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,910
Then why did you capture Orsola?

229
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,350
We don't have a reason.

230
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,540
There was never one from the beginning.

231
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,870
There is no reason?

232
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:01,430
We've always been looking out for the Priestess in secret.

233
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,810
That's how we've never strayed from the path,

234
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,190
never abused our powers,

235
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,280
and always lead our way in the right direction.

236
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,700
By Priestess, you mean Kanzaki?

237
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,650
Yeah.

238
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,120
But we destroyed her path completely.

239
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,720
Our deaths and our lack of ability caused the Priestess grief.

240
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:46,170
We must give her back her rightful place.

241
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,360
That's why we tried to help Orsola Aquinas who requested for help.

242
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:57,100
Or...sola...?

243
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,270
You said you were going to entrust her to the Roman Catholics?

244
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:08,210
She trusted you, and not the Roman Catholics.

245
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:08,950
Damn it!

246
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,320
Don't be too hasty.

247
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:16,250
The Roman Catholics can't kill Orsola here.

248
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,580
What?

249
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,900
Since things have turned out like this, I won't ask if you trust us or not.

250
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:29,390
Promise me that you will take Orsola Aquinas from the Roman Catholics,

251
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,610
and that you will bring her some place where neither of us can reach.

252
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,630
We have come to take over custody of the leader of the heretics.

253
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,960
Is that the enemy of the God?

254
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,490
Hey, wait a moment.

255
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,640
What?

256
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,260
I want to see Orsola once more.

257
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,410
Unfortunately, I'll have to decline.

258
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,830
That scream I heard just now it was Orsola's, right?

259
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,340
Where is Agnese?

260
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,250
She's over that way too, right?

261
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:09,480
Touma!

262
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,940
Sister Lucia...

263
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,360
They told us to not make any unnecessary contact with the guests...

264
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,540
Shut up, Sister Angelene!

265
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:24,820
Damn it!

266
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,320
With that filthy hand of a non-believer...

267
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,280
My shoulder... My shoulder...

268
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,700
I'm in the worst mood.

269
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,500
I'll make it look like that Amakusa guy resisted, kill all of you...

270
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,180
and silence him at the same time!

271
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,420
Touma!

272
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,550
Sister Angelene,

273
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,810
R-Right!

274
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,850
Come to me, one of the Twelve Apostles,

275
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,130
being a tax collector, {Saint Matthew}

276
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,860
the holy servant who destroys magicians!

277
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,390
Index!

278
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,610
Damn it!

279
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,070
You should worry about yourself!

280
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,660
Worry about dying with as little pain as possible!

281
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,780
Sister Angelene, why did you-

282
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,530
I-It wasn't me!

283
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,910
CTR, CTOP, AO.

284
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,060
What a sloppy job.

285
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,390
Since you weren't aware of your surroundings, you got intercepted easily.

286
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,940
Spell interceptor?

287
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,770
A retreat order?

288
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,150
Sister Angelene!

289
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,740
Y-Yes!

290
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,790
Do you understand now?

291
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,030
This is the largest faction of Christianity's, the Roman Catholics,

292
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,360
underhanded way of doing things.

I will surely, surely save Orsola.
