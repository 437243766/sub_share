1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:03,470
Three for the firmament, four for the ground...

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,350
And twelve for the world...

3
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:11,570
So you attain enormous energy by giving each number a unique meaning.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,700
It's pretty neat magic, but it isn't Christian.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,870
It's derived from Pyathagoreanism, before the advent of Christianity.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,660
When did you folks start accepting practices that were before the Son of God was born?

7
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,880
I won't gain anything from drawing this battle out.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,880
What a shame...

9
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,560
I never feel good about destroying beautiful magic.

10
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,340
<b>Testament
Self-Teaching Device</b>

11
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,430
Suppose that they're still after me...

12
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,460
I won't even be able to use my ability for another four minutes.

13
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,990
At least I'm getting that brat out of the darkness.

14
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,210
The facility is all clear.

15
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,650
There's no one here.

16
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,540
The report says that they evacuated all personnel and patients due to terrorist activities.

17
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,030
They're on to us.

18
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,080
This is bad.

19
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,950
Any traps?

20
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,970
No, we haven't found any, including infrared sensors.

21
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,230
You're late.

22
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,560
Heaven Canceller.

23
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,320
I'll be concise; I'm short on time.

24
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,170
Forget about Kihara and run.

25
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,600
Otherwise, you might lose your lives.

26
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,580
Is this some bad joke?

27
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,430
You won't stand a chance against Accelerator.

28
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,200
He won't hold back in his current state.

29
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,320
You must avoid him at all costs.

30
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,310
That's all.

31
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,920
I don't buy it.

32
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,890
Fine, but don't die.

33
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,850
I'll save you if you're still alive.

34
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,400
We've received reports from all over the world about people losing consciousness.

35
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,850
The police are investigating potential causes,

36
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,360
however, upon receiving word about similar events overseas...

37
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,970
So it's spreading overseas.

38
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,330
I was only after Academy City, but...

39
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,370
Last Order?

40
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,440
No, it's Kihara.

41
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,620
Good, you finally picked up.

42
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,600
Where have I heard this voice before...?

43
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,440
I'm calling every number in Last Order's contact list right now.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,650
You're the only one who picked up.

45
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,970
You might not know what's going on, but I need your help.

46
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,070
She's in danger.

47
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,660
What's going on, then?

48
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,650
So they split at the restaurant?

49
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,320
I'll take it from here.

50
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,300
Just toss that cell phone away and go back to being normal.

51
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,040
Yeah, shut up!

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,900
I'm helping, and I mean it!

53
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,310
Go to the bridge in District 7.

54
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,790
That's where we would meet up in emergency situations.

55
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,330
If she's still on the run, then she'll be there.

56
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,860
Okay, thanks a lot!

57
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,430
The city feels really strange today.

58
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,070
Someone's invading from the outside,

59
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,310
and Anti-Skills and the general public are unconscious everywhere.

60
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,560
They don't seem to be after anyone in particular, so be careful.

61
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,120
What a pain.

62
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,740
Sorry.

63
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,040
It was my fault for leaving her alone.

64
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,490
Don't mention it.

65
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:04,210
I also left her alone.

66
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,910
I've lost communications with several units.

67
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,350
They've either...

68
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:10,510
They've either ran away or died.

69
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,990
Either way, we have to collect their hearts later.

70
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,350
Did you collect the guys we used as decoys to take the girl's attacks?

71
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,980
Yes.

72
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,480
Due to unknown reasons, their oxygen level was very low.

73
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,050
Artificially induced asphyxiation?

74
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,990
Probably that woman.

75
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,500
Damn it!

76
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,260
If it weren't for her, they wouldn't—

77
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,870
Hey...

78
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,440
Bitch...

79
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,380
How does she aim?

80
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,950
Wait... could it be magic?

81
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,470
Whatever!

82
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,720
We're here to do what we can.

83
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,720
Do you have the Testament?

84
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:55,630
Yes.

85
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,820
Right here.

86
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,750
It's...

87
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,220
It's hers.

88
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,540
Doing well, Accelerator?

89
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,430
How can I fucking help you, Kihara-kun?

90
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,520
I was wondering if you've seen a torn piece of cloth lying around.

91
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,710
If you haven't, you should look for it.

92
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:35,440
I left it {t}here on purpose.

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,790
You know, Testament - that's some crazy stuff.

94
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,920
Injecting a virus into someone's brain isn't exactly a normal everyday thing.

95
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,200
So how am I supposed to react?

96
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,870
Should I roll on the floor and laugh for you, Mr. Masochist?

97
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,240
Hey, kid.

98
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,360
Have you completely lost your ability to analyze the situation?

99
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:02,370
Well, why are you keeping her alive?

100
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:10,690
I doubt you or your subordinates would even consider trying to bring her in unharmed.

101
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:16,390
And yet, here you are, too afraid to lay a single finger on her.

102
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,220
You're dead.

103
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,830
Something's up.

104
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:28,900
Considering his personality, he should've at least poked her eyeball out for going this far.

105
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,650
But he didn't, so...

106
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,720
My, oh my...

107
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,390
He's just a stupid gofer.

108
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,670
There's someone powerful enough to make him cower.

109
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:43,340
Could it be Academy City itself?

110
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:47,090
Then I just need to go directly to the Board of Directors...

111
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,880
Wow, I'm a genius.

112
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,480
I'm skipping right to the final boss.

113
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,510
You got to be shitting me!

114
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:01,840
Do you take me for a fool?!

115
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,990
There appears to be a commotion outside.

116
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:48,700
The Imaginary Number Sector's Five Elements Facility which uses AIM diffusion fields has completed its expansion.

117
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:56,460
Now, any magician will go berserk and die if they try to use magic within Academy City.

118
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:02,610
Vento of the Front, you are no exception.

119
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,280
It can't cover the entire world yet with its current output,

120
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:14,240
but even that will change to our advantage when Fuze Kazakiri arrives.

121
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,830
What in the world is going on?

122
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:32,440
Some unknown presence just keeps endlessly expanding.

123
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,700
Bitch...

124
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,570
What the hell are you doing here?

125
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,830
I didn't know you had a death wish!

126
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,830
Where's Last Order?

127
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,050
Last Order what?

128
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:56,060
Like I know!

129
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,690
What the?

130
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,760
Where's Vento?

131
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,120
I see.

132
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:10,690
So this is what the Imaginary Number Sector's Five Elements Facility was up to.

133
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,900
I no longer have time for a twerp like you.

134
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,980
You pompous assholes!

135
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,440
How far will you go just to look down at us?!

136
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,310
She disappeared?

137
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,760
What was she looking at?

138
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,850
No... way...

139
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,110
The deployment of the Imaginary Number Sector's Five Elements Facility will now begin.

140
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:46,420
Last Order's priority code, confirmed.

141
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,360
Fuze Kazakiri will now appear.

142
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,650
All personnel, brace for impact from the shock wave.

143
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,500
Is that... an Angel?

144
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,500
It's dangerous to be here.

145
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,230
But where in the world is Last Order?

146
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,360
Screw it...

147
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,270
Hey, I'm at the bridge, but I don't see Last Order.

148
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,800
Have you had better luck?

149
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,750
Are you stupid?

150
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,870
You gullible son of a gun.

151
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,530
I have almost figured out her whereabouts,

152
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,290
and I know that you won't be able to find her by running around.

153
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,280
I'll take it from here.

154
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,810
You just go on home.

155
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,220
You saw those wings of light too, didn't you?

156
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,470
I need to stop that Angel.

157
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,190
So it's going to be really difficult to help you.

158
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,110
No worries.

159
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,060
Sorry, and don't die.

160
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,830
You too.

161
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,230
He really had to use it didn't he?

162
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,360
Is he really going to annihilate the enemy?

163
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,820
Signal confirmed from a superior individual, ID 20001.

164
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,680
Estimated danger level: 5.

165
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,840
Misaka 10032 denies receipt.

166
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,090
Signal rejection failed.

167
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:52,790
Signal received via R, V, and Y routes.

168
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:56,320
Large loads on cognitive pathways have been found. Signal cannot be rejected.

169
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,230
If we act within the constraints of the order...

170
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:05,710
Our actions will ultimately lead to the resolution of this emergency...

171
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:15,810
Thomas Platinumburg, one of the twelve Board of Directors members.

172
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,340
Operation code name: Angel.

173
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:27,770
In order to remove an unknown threat, retrieve Last Order and overwrite the virus as a countermeasure.

174
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,110
What a bad joke.

175
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,390
That would mean the brat's still alive.

176
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:39,070
Where the hell are you hiding, Kihara?

177
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,220
What in the world is that light?

178
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:47,530
Hey!

179
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,330
What are you doing here?

180
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,260
Let me go!

181
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,730
I have to go.

182
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,670
Hyouka's there!

183
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,050
Hyouka?

184
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,220
Stop, Touma!

185
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,130
Please don't kill Hyouka!

186
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,130
Index?

187
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,430
Misaka?

188
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,810
This way.

189
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,950
Please, Touma.

190
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,660
Please don't go!

191
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:17,810
That Angel must be Hyouka!

192
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,280
That's Kazakiri?

193
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,830
I don't know why, but I just know you shouldn't be involved.

194
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:29,890
If you touch her, she'll disappear.

195
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,910
I'll deal with Hyouka, so please, please don't touch her!

196
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,570
I can't do that.

197
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,700
I have to stop her.

198
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,620
And she's not the only problem.

199
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,880
But if you use your right hand, she'll die.

200
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,110
I won't let her!

201
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,480
I'm not fighting to kill her.

202
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,960
I want to help her.

203
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,540
You think that's how she normally is?

204
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,830
Like hell it is!

205
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,350
Then we have to help her!

206
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,840
Let's go, Index.

207
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,960
I need your power to help her.

208
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:13,060
I don't really get it, but you managed to land yourself into trouble again?

209
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,500
And someone you know is somehow at the center of the mess.

210
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,490
No, no, no, she's my <i>friend !</i>

211
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,520
Let me get one thing straight.

212
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,230
She's not a bad person?

213
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:27,180
She definitely isn't.

214
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,500
You heard Index.

215
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,800
She's our friend.

216
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,760
Friend, huh?

217
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,470
That makes them the bad guys.

218
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,720
Very well.

219
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,940
I'll handle things over here.

220
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,900
Hey—

221
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,140
Sorry, I'd already started before you could stop me!

222
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,670
What the...

223
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,540
Misaka!

224
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,800
Remember the penalty game.

225
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,130
The day's not over yet, you know?

226
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,390
You're going to save your friend and come back, no matter what.

227
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,120
You got it?

228
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,510
I'll definitely come back, so you better not die too!

229
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm very irritated at the moment.

230
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:21,220
Hey Touma, is it quiet around here because of that Magician?

231
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,880
Yeah.

232
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,890
I want to know how her spell works.

233
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,380
If we want to undo it, we'll definitely need to figure that out.

234
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,690
I think it's a form of Divine Punishment.

235
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,240
Divine Punishment?

236
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,820
It's using a certain emotion as the trigger,

237
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,050
and whoever bears that emotion falls into the spell, no matter where they are.

238
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,700
That's Divine Punishment.

239
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,350
Touma, did you notice anything strange about the Magician?

240
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,610
Did she constantly try to draw out a certain emotion?

241
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,710
A certain emotion...

242
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,670
Hatred... Hostility... Malice...

243
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,720
Could those be triggering the spell?

244
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:05,630
Yeah, the effect won't go away until the Magician sees no use for it anymore.

245
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,660
Then how about Kazakiri's Angel?

246
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,430
Is she all right?

247
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,840
How am I supposed to know?!

248
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,380
It feels like I have a grimoire on something similar to this,

249
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,900
but this is using completely different parts.

250
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,110
I've never seen almost any of them.

251
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:26,250
I, at least, know that the Angel we're seeing and its core are in two different locations.

252
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,160
Kazakiri's from the Science faction.

253
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,310
Do you know something, Touma?

254
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,560
Damn, voice mail.

255
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,010
Who else is more knowledgeable about it beside Komoe-sensei whom I could I ask?

256
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,560
Misaka!

257
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,990
What do you want?!

258
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,170
I want to stop that Angel somehow.

259
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:52,880
You're my only hope.

260
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,520
Hey Misaka, did you just get hit?

261
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,670
Of course not.

262
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:02,470
You're really crazy to make me fight here with my mind elsewhere.

263
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,160
Thanks.

264
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,520
Index, ask her anything you don't know.

265
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,630
Wow, just wow!

266
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,450
What the hell is that thing?

267
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,660
You're one crazy man, Aleister.

268
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,210
I don't understand the logic nor the theory behind this!

269
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,100
What kind of scientist rejects science?

270
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,600
Take a look, everyone.

271
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,690
When did the bible turn into a pop-up art—

272
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Kihara-kun!

273
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,260
Yeah, shoot me properly.

274
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:44,830
Otherwise, you're a bother to everyone around!

275
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,690
Don't move!

276
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,660
You're so cool!

277
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,220
I think I might fall for you, Accelerator.

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:16,430
Now then, time to scrap you, shithead!

279
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,080
Kazakiri...

280
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,760
Kazakiri!

281
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,970
Kazakiri!

282
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,550
Kaza—

283
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,350
Damn it!

284
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,010
My, oh my.

285
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:57,290
Were you two sinners licking each other's wounds?

286
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,340
I was thinking about killing you later,

287
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,680
but I guess you really have a death wish.

288
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:10,900
I suppose you want to die because you can't stand seeing any more of this.

289
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,660
You won't take her.

290
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:18,670
As a member of God's Right Seat, I can't just overlook that monster.

291
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:26,610
That is blasphemy, a creation of Science that mocks all who bear the cross!

292
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,800
Hey, watch your mouth!

293
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,880
Oh, I know!

294
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,260
I'll kill you along with that exiled Angel!

295
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,890
Like I'll let you!

296
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,590
Someone put her up to this,

297
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,960
and you're asking me to let her die being treated like a monster by the likes of you?

298
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,570
You've crossed the line!

299
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,850
She's my friend, you bitch!
