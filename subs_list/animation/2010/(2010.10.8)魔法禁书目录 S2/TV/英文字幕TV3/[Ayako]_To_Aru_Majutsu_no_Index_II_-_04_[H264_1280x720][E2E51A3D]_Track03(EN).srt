1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
as someone who becomes so, is considered a non believer of the god's teachings.}

2
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,700
Touma!

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,110
Come to me, one of the Twelve Apostles,

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,270
being a tax collector,

5
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,390
the holy servant that destroys magicians!

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,030
Index!

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,600
Damn it!

8
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,910
Sister Angelene, why did you-

9
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,670
It wasn't me!

10
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:27,140
CTR, TTOP, AO.

11
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:36,050
What a sloppy job.

12
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,560
Since you weren't aware of your surroundings, you were easily intercepted.

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,300
Spell interceptor?

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,980
A retreat order?

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,360
Sister Angelene.

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,960
Y-yes.

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,900
Do you understand now?

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,910
This is the largest faction of Christianity’s, the Roman Catholics,

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,910
underhanded way of doing things.

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,880
<b>Sheol Fear{watever spelling we used)}
The Voice of Magic Destruction</b>

21
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,210
Even if everything that guy said is true,
<b>Sheol Fear{watever spelling we used)}
The Voice of Magic Destruction</b>

22
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,980
Even if everything that guy said is true,

23
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,750
Orsola Aquinas won't be killed this quickly.

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,940
They have their reasons{circumstances}.

25
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,020
What do you mean by that?

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,510
Being able to decipher "Liber AL vel Legis" is surely a threat to the Roman Catholics,

27
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,210
but Orsola Aquinas is not guilty of any sin.

28
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,900
{Since}So they can't put to death a believer of God.

29
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,090
Then why did the Amakusa try to stop the assassination of Orsola?

30
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,740
Because there are exceptions to the rule.

31
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,630
They can't put to death a believer of God.

32
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,820
If they were to abide by this rule,

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,850
it would justify the murder of those considered to be non-believers of God's teachings,

34
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,420
who have been expelled by the church.

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,890
So in short, that person will be labeled as an enemy of God.

36
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:31,180
The power of magic books cannot bring happiness to anyone.

37
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,650
There has been nothing but fighting because of these books.

38
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,770
Don't give me that...

39
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,050
Too bad, but it's the end.

40
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,500
We don't have a place in this anymore.

41
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,790
What the heck is with that?

42
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,230
What is a human life to you?!

43
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,290
This is merely the Roman Catholics using their own rules to pass judgment to an incident that happened among them.

44
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,540
Or are you saying,

45
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,610
you wouldn't mind a war breaking out just to save her?

46
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,360
That's...

47
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,310
Well, little boy.

48
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,470
There's no need to get that upset.

49
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,890
Even if the Anglican Church doesn't have a reason to fight, we absolutely do.

50
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:20,670
I'm going to pay a visit to their lair, rescue our idiots and save that Orsola-girl as well.

51
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,860
Don't tell me you're going alone.

52
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,520
Since I've no other choice, I'll have to go with what I have.

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,950
Looks like it's settled.

54
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,000
We should split up and hide our locations.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,260
You go back with Index into the Academy City.

56
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,450
I got it.

57
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,570
Oh yeah.

58
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,060
There is one thing I wanted to hear from you.

59
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,540
What is it?

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,940
That cross I gave you earlier,

61
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,920
it seems you don't have it anymore.

62
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,260
Oh, my bad.

63
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,980
I have left it in Orsola's care.

64
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,110
Was it that expensive?

65
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,390
No.

66
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,990
But there was a meaning for you to hold on to it.

67
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,290
Well, whatever.

68
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,870
It wouldn't be of any use for you now, anyway.

69
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,090
Let's go.

70
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,820
Y-Yeah.

71
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,560
What am I supposed to do?

72
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,880
There must be something I could do.

73
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,620
This is a magician's problem.

74
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,520
You don't have to force yourself into it.

75
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,110
Really?

76
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,150
It's just been really strange up to now.

77
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,080
There not one person who can singly resolve every issue that happens before them.

78
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,290
I see.

79
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,510
Right.

80
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,310
The fridge is empty.

81
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:21,740
I'll go search for a convenience store and buy some random stuff.

82
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,510
We can all go together.

83
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,110
Do you know where?

84
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,720
Not really.

85
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,500
But I should find one if I go run around the place.

86
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,130
The Orsola Church?

87
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,910
Yes.

88
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,780
She had a gift in spreading the word of God's at three places that were non-Christian,

89
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,410
so she received special permission to establish a church bearing her name.

90
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,270
I believe it was around this place.

91
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,750
Geez.

92
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,810
You shouldn't cause me so much trouble...

93
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,690
Unfortunately, I have no time to keep up with your child's play.

94
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:31,430
If you understand, then obediently accept the execution-

95
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,880
Are you even listening?

96
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,810
I just asked if you are listening or not, you slut!

97
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,480
But seriously, it looks like you don't have many reliable friends.

98
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,320
Who would've thought you'd ask for help from the Amakusa group that you just met?

99
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:58,540
Those Amakusa and Anglican Church... groups like them calling themselves Christians are just disgraceful.

100
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,930
This is what happens when you entrust your life to people like them.

101
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,290
I only had to cast sheep's eyes and they all came flocking to me.

102
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,020
Deceived...?

103
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,140
They were deceived?

104
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,600
Uh?

105
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:25,750
They weren't cooperating with you, but instead they were deceived?

106
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,030
That doesn't matter!

107
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:35,010
It's just really stupid that they just returned the person they were supposed to protect to the enemy.

108
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,450
Was that so?

109
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,830
W-What are you smiling for?

110
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,930
Was that so?

111
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,050
I'm smiling right now, am I not?

112
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:55,280
I was somehow led to understand...

113
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,000
The reality of us, the Roman Catholics.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,720
Huh?

115
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,360
They act according to what they believe in.

116
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:13,440
Having faith in the people, in their beliefs, and their feelings,

117
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,260
they will come all the way from anywhere.

118
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:23,430
On the contrary, we can only act through casting doubts.

119
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,640
How ugly is that...

120
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,020
If you want to die that badly,

121
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,590
then do as you please!

122
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:41,910
You can just die while cursing those people who made you suffer this fate.

123
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:46,290
Just... What reason do I have to curse them?

124
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,680
What?

125
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:53,710
They didn't have a reason to fight in the first place.

126
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:02,390
Yet they came to the aid of a complete stranger like me.

127
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:11,160
What greater gift is there than that in this world?

128
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:21,670
For what do I have to curse those who bestowed upon me this amazing gift?

129
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,140
Impossible, the magic barrier has been dispelled?

130
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,400
Damn it, which group is it this time?

131
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,080
I was wondering why a complete amateur in this field was able to do that.

132
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,880
So, you have something that has an absolute effect on magic barriers?

133
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,930
I will ask just in case.

134
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,620
But you don't have any intention to cover this up?

135
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,840
Cover up, what?

136
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,100
Can't you see from the situation and figure?

137
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,110
It seems like the Anglican Church has retreated, but what are you here for?

138
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,750
Look, this is your last chance.

139
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:27,020
You should know what to do.

140
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,070
You're right.

141
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,780
This is indeed my last chance.

142
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,020
So I know very well.

143
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,640
Then...

144
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,790
Why you!

145
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,030
What was that for?!

146
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,020
What I should do, you ask?

147
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,030
How lowly do you think of me?

148
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,260
Of course, I would help!

149
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,870
You are an interesting person.

150
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:02,050
Let's see what you can do in a situation when you're all alone by yourself.

151
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,620
Oh man.

152
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,080
I'd like you to not start things on your own.

153
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,290
Stiyl?!

154
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,960
The Anglican Church?

155
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,720
No way!

156
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,780
This is an internal issue within the Roman Catholic.

157
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,880
Are you not aware that this will be considered meddling with internal affairs?

158
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,140
Huh?

159
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,340
That won't be the case here.

160
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,150
Look at Orsola Aquinas' chest.

161
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:40,300
There is an Anglican Church cross on it.

162
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,770
The act of having someone place one on her,

163
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:46,410
means she is under the protection of the Anglican Church.

164
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:54,940
Therefore, Orsola Aquinas has become a member of the Anglican Church and is no longer one of the Roman Catholics.

165
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,960
Oh, so that was why...

166
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,330
You thought such simple logic would work?

167
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,390
Not really.

168
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:10,850
But if you Roman Catholics perform an inquisition with only your involvement and none of ours,

169
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,770
the Anglican Church will not just watch silently.

170
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,560
And also...

171
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,960
You sure have a lot of guts to point a weapon at her.

172
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:28,940
Did you think I'd have such a lukewarm and gentle demeanor that'd quietly turn a blind eye to that?

173
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,890
One enemy became two, could it get any better?

174
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,670
Don't think you're only facing two.

175
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:43,000
You don't have to ask me why I fight, do you?

176
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,980
Tatemiya?

177
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:55,780
I was trying to set things up with the Anglican Church, so that we could solve the issue before you made your move.

178
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,640
You're dumber than I imagined.

179
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,630
Well, I don't hate idiots that are amusing though.

180
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:09,860
Like I told you, I will solve this issue and that you won't have to worry.

181
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,690
Index?

182
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,530
But since things have turned out like this, we have to go with it.

183
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,100
Let's save her, Touma.

184
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,430
We will save Orsola Aquinas on our own.

185
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,090
Yeah!

186
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,530
Kill them!

187
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,440
Orsola, is your body hurt? {Orsola, is your body fine?}

188
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:56,270
Yes, I can endure this much.{Yes this is nothing to me.}

189
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,070
What the hell?

190
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,090
There was such a simple reason to fight laying before me this whole time.

191
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:21,970
Th-Thank you.

192
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,600
Haha.

193
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,280
You must be glad and moved to tears, eh?

194
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,100
Tsuchimikado?

195
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:44,580
Well, it's nice to see that your previous friends weren't stealing the "Liber AL vel Legis" or Orsola out of greed.

196
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,400
Are you done with business on your side?

197
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,600
I would imagine you were planning something like stealing the original "Liber AL vel Legis" under the cover of this mess.

198
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,520
You know about how things developed, right?

199
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,320
The Amakusa never stole the "Liber AL vel Legis".

200
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,470
The Roman Catholics just falsely accused them of that.

201
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,720
There was no reason to bring the "Liber AL vel Legis" to Japan in the first place.

202
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,680
The "Liber AL vel Legis" that was brought to Japan is a fake.

203
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,320
The original copy is probably still in the deepest depths of the Vatican library.

204
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,280
And are you satisfied with that?

205
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,890
Yes.

206
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:32,290
As long as they are here, the Amakusa can continue to progress on the correct path.

207
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,590
A-Are you all right?

208
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,250
Y-Yeah.

209
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,670
Damn it!

210
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:03,510
Don't make me watch a stupid scene!

211
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,100
Quit it!

212
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,640
Do not approach her needlessly.

213
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,900
If we approach her, we drain her of her ability.

214
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,030
Wh-What is this?

215
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:40,000
That song uses the knowledge of 103,000 books to thoroughly impeach contradictions in the Christian teachings.

216
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,780
"Sheol Fear."

217
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:48,570
For humans who function with an "OS" called fear, you can consider this their natural predator.

218
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,140
Listen to that, even for a short moment, you will have your human character disassembled like a puzzle.

219
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,400
Magic books aren't just to be read.

220
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,230
She can use magic books while having no magic power.

221
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,310
There is no more suitable human resource than her to use as a library of magic books.

222
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:15,950
But if you had such a secret weapon, why didn't you use it from the beginning?

223
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:23,650
That attack functions using group psychology and breaks down the heart's protective barrier.

224
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,940
So what becomes important is the purity of group psychology.

225
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,400
Those fighting with your people weren't pure enough as Kamijou Touma and I

226
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,380
were the hampering elements causing impurity.

227
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,730
Thus the attack would not have functioned well.

228
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,140
I wouldn't have come back unharmed if I were hit with those things.

229
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,450
What do we do?

230
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,260
But we can't escape...

231
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,290
Quit being so noisy!

232
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,870
We will look like idiots.

233
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:59,080
Especially you, Sister Angelene.

234
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,910
B-But... Sister Agnese...

235
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,790
At least 10 minutes have passed since the battle began.

236
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:09,050
We have them greatly outnumbered, even if we count Orsola as one of them.

237
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,880
This isn't normal.

238
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,160
Did you hear that just now?

239
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,800
Which side caused that explosion?

240
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,890
It might be that they are on the attacking side now.

241
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,160
W-We should make our move too.

242
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,360
It's better to have more people even if it’s only a little.

243
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,980
Then I will remove your duties to protect me.

244
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,460
Go join the battle upfront.

245
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,250
Y-Yes, ma'am.

246
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,360
We will surely not allow them to escape.

247
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,540
You will never escape.

248
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,270
There is no way you could escape.

249
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,200
That's how it's made.

250
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,260
This shit dripping world, I mean.

251
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,940
Focus more on attack and less on defense.

252
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:17,620
Destroy the enemy of our Lord, exterminate the enemy with no regard to our lives!

253
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,250
Some kind of magic attack?

254
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,710
No way...

255
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,950
To avoid the Sheol Fear, they...

258

The final battle has begun.

259
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:31,170
We've been cornered by their attack that continues like an avalanche.

260
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,280
Do we have any way to make a breakthrough?

261
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,560
Next episode: Lotus Wand.

262

When Science and Magic meet, the story begins.
