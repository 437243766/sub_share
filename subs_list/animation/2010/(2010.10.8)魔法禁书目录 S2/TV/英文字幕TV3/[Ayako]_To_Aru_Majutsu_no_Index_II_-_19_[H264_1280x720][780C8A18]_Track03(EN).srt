1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,170
Points to note when letting an angel descend upon a human body.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:11,460
The time when the greatest Telesma resided was undoubtedly during the Annunciation.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,520
When the aggregate amount of the child of God, the Telesma, is great enough to support the world,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,280
and has passed through the womb, it'll definitely...

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,210
Sasha-chan!

6
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,080
You're reading some musty book again.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,560
Have you not found the cause of the abnormal change in your body yet?

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,650
In that case, let me do an examination-

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,510
Sasha-chan, you've got abnormal destructive power as usual.

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:45,270
Concerning the first question, which do you prefer, the hammer or the screwdriver?

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,610
That's not what you should ask after you've already hit someone.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,270
The Telesma that was residing within you was Gabriel, wasn't it?

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,240
An unimaginable amount of power, too. Possibly even more so than the twelve Apostles.

14
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:05,630
Concerning the second question... So what?

15
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,270
The power of God is an angel that received the Annunciation, right?

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:18,150
Besides, with power exceeding that of the twelve Apostles stuffed into a girl, don't tell me that you're preg-

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,220
Sorry, that's right.

18
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:29,850
For you who wear such heavy bondage clothes every day, you won't be able to stand the idea of getting pregnant without pleasure, right?

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,690
For the third question. You shit head, quit defiling a page of the New Testament.

20
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,180
You're the superior who abused your authority and made me wear these bondage clothes in the first place!

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,960
What? Do you hate them that much?

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,460
Let's change your clothes, then.

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,980
I'm actually investigating Academy City right now.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,440
There's a unique subculture there.

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,530
Hey, Sasha-chan.

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,720
Have you heard of Magical Power Kanamin?

27
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,920
Geez, Sasha-chan.

28
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,410
<b>Researcher</b>

29
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,560
It's raining, Misaka Misaka says as she stares at the starry sky!

30
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,370
Man, that's annoying. Just keep still.

31
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,860
Misaka wanted to see the moon, Misaka Misaka says disappointedly while dancing.

32
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,250
Hey, didn't I tell you to stop running around? You foolish kid.

33
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,840
Misaka would do fine even without you protecting me that much,

34
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,490
Misaka Misaka says as she seeks freedom and liberation.

35
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,400
What kind of frontier-spirited sleep talk do you speak of?

36
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,440
And in the first place, I'm not even protecting you.

37
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,020
There you go again.

38
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,190
There's no need to be this shy,

39
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,160
says Misaka Misaka as she goes "tsun tsun" with her index finger-

40
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,780
Why are you holding your right fist with such strength,

41
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,210
asks Misaka Misaka with a placating smile, trying to relieve his rage.

42
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,930
Rain, rain, rain. Rain more,

43
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,580
Misaka Misaka chants at the evening sky.

44
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,240
Rain rain...

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,260
Are you that afraid of showing your affection for others?

46
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,560
You seem to accept the love of Last Order,

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,650
but you refuse to show affection to her.

48
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,840
You're afraid that it'll result in undesirable outcomes and cause something irreversible.

49
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,570
Ouch!

50
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:09,030
I fell, says Misaka Misaka, giving a status report while sitting on the ground.

51
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,030
Geez.

52
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,580
Look what happens.

53
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,020
Some disinfectant might be necessary,

54
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,290
says Misaka Misaka, close to tears.

55
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
Just fix it with some spit.

56
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,090
Some disinfectant might be necessary,

57
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,970
Misaka Misaka repeats.

58
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,740
We should just go back to Yomikawa's place quickly.

59
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,220
I got it.

60
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,380
Misaka Misaka understands.

61
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,370
It hurts here.

62
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,220
But Misaka Misaka will bear it and walk.

63
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,490
And follow after you...

64
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,280
Hey-

65
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,680
Misaka Misaka...

66
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,010
Wait there.

67
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,010
If you go off on your own, I'll crush you.

68
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,200
So stupid.

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,960
The accumulation of those stupid things,

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,000
is to pay for the debts.

71
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,800
Shit hole.

72
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,540
What?

73
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,940
I was expecting some idiot like this to come.

74
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,240
Do you have some grudge against me?

75
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,840
Do you want to use me in some way?

76
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,360
I don't know which it is, but...

77
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,620
I'll kill you.

78
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,370
What?

79
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,590
So fun!

80
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,300
This is crazy.

81
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,850
I even climaxed, you bastard!

82
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,500
Huh?

83
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,610
So boring.

84
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,520
Well done with the presentation.

85
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,710
I'll give you a fascinating death, so be thankful.

86
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,270
I told you guys.

87
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,390
A lukewarm solution like this is insufficient to crush that kid.

88
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,150
It has to be me.

89
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,380
Kihara-kun, eh?

90
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,700
What is that "oh, I'm hiding something" appearance for?

91
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:31,070
It's quite different from the intellectual wimp who couldn't look someone in the eye.

92
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:35,280
Personally, I didn't want to see you either.

93
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,720
It's orders from above, so I had no other choice.

94
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:42,590
It seems it's an emergency or something, and they have no choice on method.

95
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,280
So you see...

96
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,840
It's pitiful for you, but can't you be crushed here?

97
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,840
Who do you think allowed your ability to surface?

98
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,800
What?

99
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
What is it?

100
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,860
What do you say?

101
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,680
That line filled with the nuance of loyalty and obligation...

102
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,840
Don't tell me you expect me to repay you.

103
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,790
Oh, how screwed up.

104
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,970
Rather, you'd better go insane on your own.

105
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,490
I can count more researchers who've messed around with my body than fingers on both my hands .

106
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,610
You thought I'd be so sensitive as to keep memories of you?

107
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,190
You really are an annoying bastard, aren't you?

108
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,780
I really want to kill you. I want to kill you like crazy.

109
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,400
I should have killed you properly that time.

110
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,430
It really was my failure.

111
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,010
What was I doing?

112
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,500
So I'm killing you.

113
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,620
You bastard!

114
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,530
What are you thinking, you idiot-

115
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,840
Now, what...

116
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,130
The reflection isn't working!

117
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,170
Hey idiot, I'll tell you again.

118
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:59,830
Who do you think gave you that ability?

119
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,340
So, do you remember now?

120
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,860
What?

121
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,830
It doesn't suit you.

122
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,970
I'll pick that up for you.

123
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,350
You should relax and become part of the wall as a stain.

124
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,310
That would be more suited for you.

125
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,100
Quit the nonsense,

126
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,560
you loser!

127
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,610
Such failure.

128
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,000
You...

129
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,580
Don't tell me... You performed supernatural ability development on your own body...

130
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,350
What?

131
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,450
That's wrong.

132
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:12,600
It's not like that.

133
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,460
That's stuff you do on lab rats.

134
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:22,730
I don't have to do such stupid stuff just to crush someone like you.

135
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,480
This is working fine today.

136
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:34,730
You've decided to be a corpse at least, bastard!

137
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,470
Oh right.

138
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,010
You thought these gloves were the secret to my ability.

139
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,300
But it isn't so.

140
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,630
You still feel like you're the strongest?

141
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,390
You scrap bastard!

142
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,770
Your reflection is no absolute wall.

143
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,330
It only reverses the vector of forces that come your way.

144
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,280
Then there's a simple countermeasure.

145
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,790
I just have to retract my fist back right before the hit connects. {B: Wait, wouldn't this result in the hit never contacting?}

146
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,910
I could say it's application of non-contact martial arts.

147
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,120
So that means that you're purposely hitting yourself.

148
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,990
You understand now, Masochist-kun?

149
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,840
Maybe it was a bit too difficult for a kid's mind like yours.

150
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,880
That wind was done the same way.

151
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,280
Your ability is constructed upon vector calculations.

152
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,610
Then I can just mess that up.

153
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,150
With things like special sound waves, I can jam it all!

154
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,940
I know all about your speciality, your calculations, your personal reality.

155
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,870
I didn't develop your ability for nothing.

156
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,450
So, Accelerator.

157
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,160
You don't understand the meaning of that in the first place.

158
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:05,500
Why was the 3rd rank Railgun used in the Radio Noise project and not you, the 1st rank?

159
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,880
There's something to it.

160
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,420
Something you don't understand at all.

161
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,270
You shit hole.

162
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,730
What a moving moment.

163
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,620
Look.

164
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,280
The one we talk about is really happy too.

165
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,810
I guess we should say retrieval is complete.

166
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,420
Too bad.

167
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,770
It was supposed to be a live capture of the main target.

168
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,450
But is that really alive?

169
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:34,410
I'd hate to have to write an apology letter for something like this.

170
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,360
She is still alive.

171
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,230
If she had died,

172
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,710
there would be some effect on the sisters' surrogate calculation.

173
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,510
I have no proof.

174
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,170
But...

175
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:50,160
If it ends like this, she would never...

176
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:54,210
Last Order!

177
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,870
Ah man.

178
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,200
She's not a golf ball, you know.

179
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,880
Don't let people fly in magnitudes of yards.

180
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,090
Geez.

181
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,770
Who do you think has to go retrieve it?

182
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,620
I won't, though.

183
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,630
What do we do?

184
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,250
You know, split the group into three.

185
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,130
One goes after the main target.

186
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,190
Two shall remain with me.

187
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,720
But the most important order was to retrieve the Last Order.

188
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,660
Oh?

189
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,980
You're one of the people who were added into Hound Dog as a replacement recently, eh?

190
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,580
N-No...

191
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,190
Oh, it's fine.

192
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,310
I'm not trying to figure out your identity or anything.

193
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:48,330
It's just that if you don't understand the rules, I'll tell you now.

194
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,010
You're a bunch of trash.

195
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,200
There are no such thing as human rights.

196
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,070
We can easily replace trash with trash.

197
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:01,210
If you get in the way of my very important plan, I'm fine with killing you.

198
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,200
You understand?

199
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,470
You've already died once.

200
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,130
I'll reconfirm.

201
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,740
Do you understand?

202
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,390
All right.

203
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:12,630
If you understand then it's fine.

204
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,490
Rivers, water reservoirs, anything is fine.

205
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,310
Just search for areas with water.

206
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:22,460
This kid wouldn't shoot her without calculating the drop point.

207
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,010
Wh-What should we do with this?

208
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,490
Should we retrieve it?

209
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,770
No, I'll kill it.

210
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,360
There's no reason to capture it.

211
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,880
It annoys me to see people who work hard like this.

212
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,960
These self-sufficing society shut-outs like them

213
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,530
are better off dead.

214
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,090
Shut up.

215
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,630
You .

216
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,180
You will never figure out your life.

217
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,910
Oh, really?

218
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,600
Then I will kill you. But I can consider those your last words, eh?

219
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,550
Shit head...

220
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,230
Wake up, lucky.

221
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,990
I'll give you credit.

222
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,830
Feel free to crush me and laugh like crazy.

223
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,860
Someone...

224
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,500
Just anyone...

225
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,940
That kid...

226
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,950
What are you doing there?

227
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,170
Geez, that Index.

228
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,380
She disappears the moment we meet.

229
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,190
Touma, you have no consideration for others.

230
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,380
The white person I met before let me eat hamburgers without even asking for my reasons.

231
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,690
Touma needs to become a kind person like him.

232
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,080
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,030
I have no relationship with people like him.

234
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,000
Rather, did you thank that person properly?

235
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,030
I'm a person who can thank people properly!

236
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,840
Oh...

237
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,420
Oh? What is it?

238
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,940
Come to think of it...

239
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,550
I might have borrowed this.

240
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,270
Just a tissue paper pack?

241
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:04,620
Oh, what if he's in trouble because he doesn't have this cutting-edge technological item?

242
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:08,000
Touma, I will go return this to him.

243
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,020
Having something like that returned will just trouble him-

244
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,470
Oh, hey!

245
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,650
Geez.

246
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,640
She's always...

247
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,720
Huh?

248
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,410
Rain?

249
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,260
Oh right, Index didn't carry an umbrella.

250
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:35,400
There seem to be more Anti-skill personnel than usual.

251
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,660
I should find Index quickly before things become troublesome-

252
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,670
Wh-What's wrong?

253
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,300
Hello?

254
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:01,070
H-Hey... what is this?

255
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,510
There seems to be nothing wrong with their vital signs.

256
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,010
But what in the world happened?

257
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:15,510
Infiltrated the city area.

258
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,160
I repeat, gate destruction is confirmed.

259
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,850
The intruder has reached city area.

260
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,910
We are engaging unidentified enemy-

261
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,500
An intruder?

262
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,330
Index!

263
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,420
You're...

264
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,800
Help...

265
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,140
I beg you to help that person...

266
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,570
Misaka Misaka begs.

267
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,280
Hi, Aleister.

268
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,750
Surely you're eavesdropping on normal connections like this.

269
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,460
I'd be happy if you faced me quickly.

270
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,160
What's your business?

271
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:18,600
I just screwed over three members from the Administrative Board Meeting.

272
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,710
I guess that's not enough to make you feel anything.

273
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:23,290
Replacements are possible.

274
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,580
Limitlessly.

275
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:32,000
I imagined that your opinions were the collective thoughts of the Administrative Board Meeting.

276
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,250
I guess I got the wrong picture.

277
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,210
Fine, whatever.

278
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,840
Do you know who I am?

279
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,950
I wonder who.

280
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,150
The Right Seat to God.

281
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,420
If you are going to act like you know nothing, then it's fine.

282
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,540
But don't regret it later.

283
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,310
Are you not underestimating this city?

284
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,330
Oh my?

285
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,680
You seem to not understand the true state of your own city.

286
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,030
Anti-skill and who were they... Judgment?

287
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,680
Because you try to defend yourselves with puny things like them,

288
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,910
you're easily assassinated.

289
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,920
You should know by now that you are already finished.

290
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:14,650
If you think that you've already destroyed the defence net of Academy City with just that,

291
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,580
then you really are foolish.

292
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,430
You don't understand the true form of this city at all.

293
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,250
Oh, really?

294
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,160
I mean, you are not the only one that hides a secret ace card.

295
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,500
Though you may be crushed before you figure that out.

296
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,970
Whatever it is,

297
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,610
I will smack and destroy whatever opposes me.

298
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,930
This is something that has been decided ever since I was born.

299
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,740
I am Vento of the Front.

300
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,970
The final weapon of the two billion believers of Roman Catholicism.

301
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,890
I'll crush everything in this one night.

302
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,490
You, Academy City, the Imagine Breaker, and the Index Prohibitorum.

303
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,230
All of them!

304
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,970
Interesting.

305
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,430
Finally a chance to use that has appeared.

306
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,370
Though the timing is too soon,

307
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,350
irregular outcomes are the best entertainment in a situation bound by Plan.

308
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,780
Hound Dog, Kihara Amata.

309
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,590
This is Kihara.

310
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,220
Imaginary Number School District, Five Line Organization,

311
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,390
the AIM diffusion field.

312
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,770
Though it's a bit soon, we will crush them using Fuse Kazagiri.

313
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,470
As soon as you capture 20001 who is escaping,

314
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:38,800
carry her to the specified place.

315
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,010
Do it quickly and neatly.

316
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,840
Understood.

317
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,050
So then,

318
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,970
it's the long awaited show time.

319
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,290

A pursuit battle concerning Last Order began.

322
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:32,370
He will face them alone, just to protect the girl.

323
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,150
Next episode: Hound Dog.

324
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:37,850
When science and magic cross, the battle begins.
