1
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:18,250
Since {it's}this is a punishment, you must heed to whatever I say. {Since it's a punishment game, you have to listen to whatever I say.}

2
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,450
It really bothers me!

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,360
Ever since the Daihaseisai, she's been like this every night until now.

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:30,380
Onee-sama!  Who exactly is it that makes you look so sweet and fearful?

5
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,450
What else shall I make you do?

6
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:44,190
Really? Onee-sama, what exactly is that soft pillow a replacement for?{what are you pretending that soft pillow is?}

7
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,330
<b>Punishment</b>

8
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,240
Watch!

9
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,420
Everyone's clothes changed while I was hospitalized, says Misaka, Misaka-

10
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,750
You're dressed for too cool, idiot.{???}{cool climate}

11
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,680
Rather, you shouldn't be looking outside while sitting on top someone's lap who is still half-sick and recovering, you stupid brat.

12
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,180
How cruel!

13
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,640
I've also just recovered as well, says Misaka, Misaka-

14
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,900
Yeah, yeah, enough of that.

15
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,230
You can do you heart warming fights after you've arrived at your new home.{accomodation.}

16
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,580
And where is that new home?{accomodation?}{replace what with where?}

17
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,030
As for now, it's at my acquaintance's place.

18
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,950
You're going to quit {your}the school you're in now, right?

19
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:06,470
I'm sick of being involved with that Level 6 stuff now.

20
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,630
The person I'll be {putting}placing you with is not a researcher.

21
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,210
So I'm sure you will be friends with her. {She will surely be your friend.}

22
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,630
So we're going to be having one more idiot. {of this kind.}

23
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,240
Phew...

24
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,010
I want an encounter.

25
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:27,350
What are you doing?

26
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,690
Well, when you say that, it only sounds like you're being sarcastic.

27
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:37,400
Those words might trigger {some many}a lot of strange girls to appear from all over.

28
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,990
Yes, you're right.

29
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,870
If it's Kami-yan, he'll somehow meet super robot girls to lake spirit princesses!  {If it's with you, you somehow manage with a super electronic style robot to a lady from the spring}{pond}{.}{Any other editors wanna help with this?}{needs moar editan}

30
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,870
That being said, can you watch this for now?

31
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,540
Shoulder Rubbing Holder-kun?

32
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,130
I might look this way, but I have a terrible ache in my shoulder.

33
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,670
I'm pretty sure this would be very effective.

34
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,250
What are your thoughts?

35
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,970
{I've no doubts}I'm certain that this is fraud.

36
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:01,840
You'll be making complaint calls later and-

37
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,220
So having your non-blood related sister rub your shoulders is the best...

38
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
I can see where you're intending to lead me!

39
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,150
Then present{show?} me a better shoulder ache treatment that's not a non-blood related sister.

40
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,770
How many times do I have to tell you, this Shoulder Rubbing Holder-kun is that solution?

41
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,730
Rather, you have someone well suited for that.

42
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,880
Huh?

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,860
Someone who's always being bothered by her{this} shoulder ache{always}, and is completely in love with purchasing things like this off mail order...

44
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,360
So as I was saying, world peace is...

45
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,850
Is Fukiyose there?

46
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,750
Huh?

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,330
It's my once in a lifetime favor to ask you.

48
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,800
Let me rub them, Fukiyose!

49
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,640
Now then everyone,

50
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,890
next up is my chemistry lessons.

51
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,070
The classroom{tender warm room} suddenly changed into a {rule-less} battlefield! {class all of a sudden!}

52
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,530
It's for world peace!

53
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,420
Now{So} then, starting today, you will all be participating in rehabilitation little by little...

54
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,620
But are you all fine with having the Tokiwadai Junior High's winter uniform as your clothes to go outside?

55
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,290
No problem, answers Misaka 10032.

56
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,210
All 4 of you have the same size too...

57
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,500
There's no need to measure because we all match.

58
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,880
Quickly answers Misaka 13577.

59
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,680
There isn't a reason for difference in size.

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,890
Adds Misaka 10039.

61
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,310
M-Misaka says...

62
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,690
Is anything wrong, 19090?

63
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,810
Asks Misaka-

64
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,400
There's enough space for two fingers to get in.

65
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,860
Misaka 10032 makes an emergency report.

66
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,740
All Misaka should be identical.

67
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,990
Misaka 13577 shows astonishment.

68
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,120
How about the bust size and other sizes?

69
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Misaka 10039 suggests for a complete close-up examination.

70
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,880
Well, there will be some variation from eating patterns and work out.

71
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,470
So has she been doing what they {so}call a diet secretly from the other Misaka? {could be worded better}

72
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,010
Misaka 10032 continues to question.

73
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,140
Come to think of it, 19090 has been seen continuously reading a women's magazine.

74
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,570
Misaka 13577 remembers.

75
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:31,410
That time, she had secretly obtained information that if you put a ring you got from a man who you love on your ring finger on your left hand you are in the winner side. {winner side?}{lolwut}

76
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,410
Misaka 10039 leaks this information at the appropriate time.

77
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,080
Ring...

78
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,410
Winner...

79
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,450
Misaka is...

80
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:48,170
If you do the same as 19090-san, won't you have the same variation?

81
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:53,590
Misaka is following advice from its critical analysis ability, and shall escape!

82
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,010
Says Misaka!

83
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,180
You're here!

84
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,770
You finally are here damn it!

85
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,390
Huh?

86
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,520
This is...

87
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,740
What you say...

88
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,110
What misfortune.

89
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,820
What's up with the response you give me as soon as you see my face?

90
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,490
And?

91
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:12,200
Do you have any business with me, Biribiri?

92
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,700
Do you think you have the right {for you to be with} to have that {such an }attitude right now?

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,180
Huh?

94
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,660
You're going to be punished!

95
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,170
Huh?

96
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,040
Oh...

97
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,790
That was still valid?

98
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,920
Don't just forget all about it.

99
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,930
Anyways, you will be listening to whatever I want no matter what.

100
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,970
Not like there are many things some commoner like you could do.

101
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,100
But for that matter, you better try what you can do.

102
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,900
Oh...?

103
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,060
I got it.

104
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,700
Fine!

105
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,230
I shall obey your every command! {Then order me anything!}

106
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,260
Ojou-sama, you will first need a comfortable environment.

107
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,000
I, Kamijou Touma, am not very competent.

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,240
So I apologize {already}for not being {unable to be}considerate!

109
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,380
Hey idiot!

110
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,340
Don't wave so much from under my skirt!

111
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,330
Onee-sama?

112
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,710
K-Kuroko?

113
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,300
W-What determined obedience position is that?

114
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,510
This half-monkey...

115
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,600
He's more than just a commoner.

116
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,850
However...

117
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,600
I am supposed to be the one in his stead! {I am the one actually supposed to be in this position!}

118
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,600
Cut it out, idiots!

119
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,850
What kind of weird ceremony is this?

120
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,810
Am I some {great}religious leader from some cult?

121
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,580
She will be the person looking over you.

122
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,570
What is this?

123
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,740
Oh?

124
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,450
You forgot my face already?

125
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:42,410
I'm not talking about you!

126
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,290
I'm talking about this unexplainable creature over here!

127
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,460
Unexplainable? What does that mean?!

128
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,170
I might look like this, but I'm actually a teacher, you know!

129
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,130
Damn.

130
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,300
So they've already completed the research on stopping cells from aging.

131
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,220
U-Umm...

132
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,760
It's not like that, but...

133
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,530
How pitiful...

134
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,900
She must be used in experiments so much that she won't have any free time in her future... {either...}

135
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,190
Misaka Misaka{will} puts a handkerchief on her eye and weeps.

136
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,190
Listen to what I have to say!

137
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,240
Well, you're doing well getting attention.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,490
I wasn't brought here for entertainment, was I?

139
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,000
I will be bringing you to my apartment.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll get a car now.

141
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,620
Is it all right?

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,470
Letting someone like me stay.

143
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,710
It's not a problem.

144
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,340
I have vacant rooms so there's nothing-

145
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,260
That's not what I mean.

146
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,940
By hiding me, it's equivalent to facing the shitty dark side of the Academy City all by yourself.

147
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,230
That's why.

148
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,690
Did you forget what my job was?

149
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,770
I believe there are few people who would directly attack an Anti-skill's home without consideration.

150
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,900
Don't complain if you die.

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,400
I'm fine.

152
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:04,280
Your name may be placed on their list.

153
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,790
It's our job to rehabilitate people like that.

154
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,590
But I'm relieved.

155
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:15,250
You seem to be much easier to save than from what I heard about you.

156
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,380
Are you seriously saying that?

157
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,130
Despite what you've been saying, you still try to take the risk away from us.{the soon to be your room master}{ie, you're kinder than what descriptions we have received, since you seem to be protective of those around you}

158
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,810
So by that, you can say you're willing to protect us, right?

159
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,780
Damn.

160
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,690
That's why I mean idiots of this kind are impossible to deal with.

161
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,200
<i>Late.</i>

162
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,710
<i>What is he doing?</i>

163
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,960
13:00 sharp at Seventh's Mist!

164
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,920
If you're late by even a second, you know what'll happen, right?

165
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,660
Geez.

166
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,640
Now I look pathetic.

167
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,220
We're having soumen again!

168
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,540
No way!

169
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,480
Why do we keep having this everyday?

170
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,400
What is this?

171
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,240
Are you applying the culture called food for some internal body conditioning magic?

172
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,580
I just happened to receive the same goods from different people!

173
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,600
Have some {consideration}sympathy for {me}the person who has to improvise and be creative day after day with innovations like salad-style, pasta-style and udon-style!

174
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,320
Huh?

175
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,330
Tsuchimikado Maika?

176
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,590
I wanted to share this happiness with someone!

177
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,000
Huh?

178
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,780
These, these! {It's this I mean.}

179
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:39,290
Since maids basically {mustn't}can't stand out...

180
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,330
We would put emphasis on collars and sleeves like this, and secretly show our originality.

181
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm very high spirited at the moment, so let me listen to every little worry you might have.

182
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,150
I want to learn a new way of eating soumen!

183
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:03,150
Weren't they cutting down on public servant salaries?

184
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,710
Since this facility doubles as an architectural testing ground, some fraction of the rent is paid by the university.

185
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,400
Oh, really?

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,230
Amazing!

187
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,720
There's not even a dust particle.

188
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,960
Misaka Misaka praises it, while lying on the sofa.

189
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,420
They made you write another apology again, right?

190
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,600
Oh, I wonder what you're talking about.

191
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,260
Huh?

192
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:29,020
She has the habit of cleaning her room when something goes wrong.

193
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,700
Since she does it without thinking {deeply }about it, she often loses things like the room key.

194
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,770
I-Is that how you should refer to someone {you owe,}who is {looking for}trying to find you a new job{ for you}?

195
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,370
That means your kitchen is as usual, right?

196
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,590
Hey, you were eating the dishes I prepared like it was delicious too, Kikyou.

197
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:48,590
As long as I {don't figure}never find out how you were making them.

198
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,620
Oh, my.

199
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,320
Why are there so many rice cookers?

200
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,750
Misaka Misaka counts them!

201
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,590
Rice cookers are an almighty machine that can do anything!

202
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,720
He won't appear...

203
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,210
Misaka-san.

204
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,490
Oh, Uiharu-san.

205
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:09,140
Umm... Shirai-san was supposed to be here to receive something.

206
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,100
Oh, right...

207
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,960
I shoved my Judgment work on her and-

208
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,980
No, err... She's very busy with her work,

209
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,930
so I came her in place...

210
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,010
Oh really?

211
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,410
As expected of Tokiwadai Middle School.

212
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,240
It's amazing that you have violin lessons for class.

213
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,260
It's nothing that significant.

214
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,760
You want to try and play a little then?

215
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,080
Yes, like that, use your jaw and collarbone to hold the instrument.

216
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,780
Hold the neck softly with your left hand.

217
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,750
Hold the bow perpendicular to the strings.

218
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,510
And slowly...

219
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,050
See, it's easy.

220
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,310
Misaka-san...

221
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,700
It's like I'm dreaming...

222
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,700
What's wrong?

223
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,390
U-I-Ha-Ru~?

224
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,810
Geez.

225
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,860
I'm so sorry.

226
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,130
You know, I'm the winner of the battle that decided who gets punished.

227
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,370
So why do I have to wait here for an hour?

228
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,930
W-Well you see, there are complicated reasons for that..

229
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,610
Oh, right...

230
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,860
We promised to meet up here at 13:00 right?

231
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:25,300
You were here 30 minutes before that?

232
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,710
Well then, I'm sorry.

233
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,850
I-I wasn't waiting here exactly 1 hour before the meeting time...

234
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,430
Misaka, you...

235
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,630
Like I said...

236
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,290
I'm...

237
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,480
You wanted to see me in pain from punishment that much?

238
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,270
Eh...

239
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,700
You might be more treacherous than I imagined.

240
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,900
So I was correct...

241
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,940
You lost that time, so quit revolting against me!

242
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:54,120
You would do whatever I say, right?

243
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,210
You can tell me anything, but there are limits to what I can do.

244
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,700
You would do it, right?

245
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,080
Follow me!

246
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,980
To where?

247
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,050
Just follow me without saying a word.

248
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,670
That's your first punishment!

249
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,580
So it's not going to be just one?

250
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,400
Handy antenna service?

251
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:18,730
Oh, like how they make personal mobile phones become an area station.

252
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,030
Yes.

253
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,600
We can build a network with the subscribers.

254
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,070
And also, if you make it a pair contract, the talk rate becomes cheaper too.

255
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,110
A pair contract?

256
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,910
And, if we make a pair contract now, they'll give us a Lovely Mitten Gekota strap.

257
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,020
Huh?

258
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,470
So sign up with me.

259
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,920
So you just wanted a strap?

260
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,110
Rather, if it's just a frog, you already-

261
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,380
You shall join!

262
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,610
But you know, isn't a pair contract for lovers and the sort?

263
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:55,790
I-Idiot, what made you think that?

264
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,410
Even if it's limited to couples,

265
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,740
it doesn't have to be just lovers!

266
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,350
For example, they could be husband and wife too!

267
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,820
Hello, I hope you {understand}realize that's more serious than lovers, Misaka-san.

268
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:11,470
I-It's punishment, so follow me without complaining!

269
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,040
We'll also need photos to complete the paperwork...

270
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,680
Like an identification photo?

271
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,500
No, if there's something that would let us know that you're a pair...

272
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:26,250
If you two are in the same frame together, it could even be a mobile phone picture.

273
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,200
A photo together?

274
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,810
So what should we do?

275
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,020
Should we settle with a mobile photo photo for now?

276
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,670
R-Right...

277
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,040
Then I'll be taking the shot.

278
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,340
Just to make sure,

279
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,770
you're the one who said you wanted this, right?

280
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,560
Of course, I know that.

281
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,530
Wait for me, Gekota!

282
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,110
I'll be taking the shot.

283
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,090
Fine!

284
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,350
Come anytime!

285
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,700
Your face is awkward, Misaka.

286
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,540
And why are you looking the other way?

287
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,250
I think this wouldn't be considered a pair.

288
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,670
Let's take another shot.

289
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,290
Like I said, why is your expression frozen?

290
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:16,340
And why do you pull yourself away from me?

291
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,390
Anyways, a two-shot is supposed to look like we're lovers right?

292
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,770
Then I'll do this!

293
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,300
Smile, Misaka!

294
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,430
This photo is just for a document, right?

295
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:28,070
If you think of it like that, there's nothing to worry about!

296
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,850
Y-Yes, you're right.

297
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,000
I just have to get a photo that makes it look like it.

298
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,710
We're just taking a photo...

299
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:36,550
I'm taking a photo!

300
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,360
Yes~!

301
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,840
Geez.

302
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,950
I thought he was just a slave that just popped out, but I foolishly underestimated him.

303
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,920
Onee-sama, you've been doing all sorts of things around.{what?  around him?}

304
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,040
D-Don't misunderstand me, okay?

305
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,360
I just wanted a Gekota strap and...

306
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
I was trying to get a photo for a pair contract...

307
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,480
Then you don't have to ask a man like this!

308
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,800
There's no problem if you and me were to become a pair!

309
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,300
Now let's take a picture.

310
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,130
Hey, Kuroko!
We'll be taking many pictures!

311
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,890
Let's make a lifetime valid memory here.

312
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:17,500
Hey, Kuroko where are you taking me?!
Let's make a lifetime valid memory here.

313
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,700
If that's fine, then can I go home already?

314
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,940
I said it has to be a man and woman pair!

315
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:33,630
Hitotsui Hajime-san, mostly known for your live performance activities, will be starring in a movie this occasion.

316
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,280
I slept...
And I hear it's amazingly a Hollywood movie.

317
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,900
And I hear it's amazingly a Hollywood movie.

318
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,430
Did you have some special troubles with anything?

319
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,680
<i>Damn idiot.</i>
Did you have some special troubles with anything?

320
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,250
I must have been too relaxed.
<i>Damn idiot.</i>

321
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:45,440
<i>Even though I can only fight for 15 minutes max with this placed on me...</i>
I must have been too relaxed.

322
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:45,560
<i>Even though I can only fight for 15 minutes max with this placed on me...</i>

323
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,860
Hitotsui Hajime-san jumps into Hollywood in his first movie starring!!

324
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,690
There's no one here?

325
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,830
Whatever, I'll take a shower then.

326
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,830
Why do you appear without any sign?

327
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,040
Misaka Misaka thrusts her arms out for the bath towel, but it's too late.

328
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,720
Why didn't you lock the door?

329
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,150
Oh, I'm sorry.

330
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,940
I've been living all alone up until now, so I forgot.

331
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,980
{Aiho}Idiot, cover them up for now.

332
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,190
You two don't feel anything even though you've been seen naked?

333
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,860
Misaka Misaka makes an innocent question.

334
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,180
It's nothing to get that excited about.

335
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,150
He's a kid, we're adults.

336
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:46,450
Instead of sounding like an adult, that sounds more like an old woman.

337
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,080
Misaka-

338
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,950
Ouch!

339
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:51,000
Have some sense of security will you?
Suddenly the two are crushing my head!

340
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,960
Something like that happened, Misaka Misaka reports after it all happened.

341
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,290
If you said that, then it has already been broadcasted through the network.

342
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:04,620
So there isn't a need to say that again in words, am I wrong?

343
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,230
Misaka points out calmly.

344
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:09,620
I want to say it as many times as I can in words!

345
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,260
Misaka Misaka can't forgive this outrage!

346
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:15,860
And you got locked out by the auto lock system in the apartment.

347
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,780
What a stupid situation you've been placed in.

348
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,700
Had I not passed by, would you have been all alone?

349
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,020
Misaka secretly laughs in the heart.

350
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm not to blame, the auto lock is!

351
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,720
Misaka Misaka rages!

352
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,170
Huh?

353
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,760
Hey, where did that damn brat go?

354
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,450
Come to think of it...

355
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,020
You mean this?

356
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,680
Misaka makes a confirmation move to an unexpected question.

357
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,540
All other Misaka have this, but I don't.

358
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,480
Misaka Misaka eyes with envy.

359
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,810
That Misaka is that Misaka and this Misaka is this Misaka.

360
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:00,110
Misaka indirectly suggests to give up.

361
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:03,440
Geez Misaka wants that too!

362
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Misaka Misaka uses her little figure to the most and uses her stubborn little girl negotiation tactics.

363
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,640
You must be trying to do some cute moves, but...

364
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,270
those of the same sex will just find it annoying so it's counterproductive.

365
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:19,210
Misaka explains nicely.

366
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,130
Hey 10032, bow down for a moment.

367
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,840
Misaka Misaka asks.

368
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,620
Gotcha!

369
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,740
Misaka Misaka succeeds in the forced steal plan.

370
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,790
Get it back if you feel annoyed.

371
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:41,720
Misaka Misaka goes on a mad dash while enjoying the feeling of victory.

372
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,530
The time for revolution has come.

373
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,820
Declares Misaka 10032 here.
