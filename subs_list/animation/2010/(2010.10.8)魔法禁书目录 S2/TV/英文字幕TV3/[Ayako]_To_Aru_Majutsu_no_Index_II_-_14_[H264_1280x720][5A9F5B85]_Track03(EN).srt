1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,310
I, Kamijou Touma, am an unfortunate human.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,610
You would be able to understand by looking back at the past seven days of the Daihaseisai.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,160
I already had to handle lots of trouble on the very first day.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,830
On the second day, I witnessed Komoe-sensei changing.

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,040
Immediately after her recovery, I got head butted by Fukiyose Seiri.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,500
Then I got hit with a rubber ball thrown by Himegami Aisa who was riding on a wheel chair.

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,470
While I was being forced to folk dance with Misaka Mikoto,

8
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,920
Shirai Kuroko delivered a drop-kick to the back of my head...

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,180
Somehow... I'm all worn out after going through all those things.

10
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,700
To sum it all up, Kamijou Touma is an unfor-

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,650
Congratulations!

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,030
This is the annual Daihaseisai closing day lottery for visitors,

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,490
the number you've chosen has won first prize!

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,990
Your prize is:

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,920
A trip of seven days and five nights for two to Northern Italy!

16
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,790
Huh?

17
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,200
A trip to Italy?

18
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,810
<b>The Metropolis of Water</b>

19
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,300
Although I may sound redundant, I, Kamijou Touma, am an unfortunate human.
<b>The Metropolis of Water</b>

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,390
Although I may sound redundant, I, Kamijou Touma, am an unfortunate human.

21
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,910
I don't have a passport!

22
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,600
Huh? Waffos a paffporf?

23
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,950
I knew it...

24
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,500
I knew that it would turn out like this from the start ...

25
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,540
The trip is in two days.

26
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,030
Trying to get a new passport all of a sudden is...

27
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,080
Isn't that my passport?

28
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,380
I see...

29
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,510
So it seems as though I've travelled abroad before...

30
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,760
Touma, Touma!

31
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,510
If you mean something like this, I have one too!

32
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,640
Hey, there's no stamp or even a country here!

33
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,280
How the heck did you make it this far?

34
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:35,810
So Touma, if I have something like this, is it okay for me to go on the trip with you?

35
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,530
Uh...

36
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,330
Huh?

37
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,580
I have a feeling that it will turn out better this time...

38
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,660
Although I'm supposed to be an unfortunate human.

39
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,200
You haven't forgotten anything, right?

40
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,260
Like your wallet, your passport and the flight ticket...

41
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,050
Some necessary documents and a change of clothes?

42
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,050
Eh, what else?

43
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,470
Touma, Touma!

44
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,640
Why have you been so worried up until now?

45
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,680
Y-You're right.

46
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,230
Yeah! We should just enjoy ourselves, right?

47
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,150
Okay!

48
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,070
The trip of seven days and five nights to Northern Italy!

49
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:08,190
I shall fully enjoy this exciting event that I haven't been able to experience for quite some time!

50
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,140
Oh!

51
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,410
Let go of me...

52
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,280
U-Ummm, excuse me...?

53
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,820
What is this?

54
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,830
Damn it!

55
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,080
Run for it, Index!

56
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,870
We can't board the plane if we don't get you into proper clothes!

57
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,750
Heh? What Touma? You're going to buy clothes for me?

58
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,750
Another 1.5 km until we arrive at the shopping area...

59
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,760
28 minutes until our plane takes off.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,840
God damn it!

61
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,050
Such misfortune!

62
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,680
Oh man, it's really close to the sea.

63
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,490
Rather than saying "it's close to the sea", you should be saying "it's surrounded by the sea".

64
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:59,910
There's an island town in the Adriatic Sea at the heart of Chioggia.

65
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:00,770
Oh, really?

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,390
At first, we were running around the airport looking for spare safety pins.

67
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:23,060
Then our guide in Italy left us behind, I was wondering what would happen,

68
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,730
but we somehow managed to arrive.

69
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:31,400
I think that you should at least be trilingual if you want to live in the present international community.

70
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,900
Why am I being lectured by this strange sister about things like "the present" or "at least"...

71
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,250
We've got to carry all our stuff to a hotel before we eat.

72
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,790
I already knew that without you telling me!

73
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,630
You know what?

74
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,000
The food is fine and all,
Oh my, it must be the real...

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,420
but let's go to Venice once we've checked in.
Oh my, it must be the real...

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,340
but let's go to Venice once we've checked in.

77
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,710
I've always wanted to ride on a gondola!

78
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,340
Huh?

79
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
Hey!

80
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,170
Index!

81
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,480
Hey...

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,100
Index...

83
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,530
At this rate, I'll be the one who's going to get lost...

84
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,280
Ciao, are you in trouble?

85
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,640
Yes?

86
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,500
Can you speak Italian?

87
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,460
There's a Japanese restaurant ahead.

88
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,370
Hallo- That was wrong... What was it again?

89
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,250
Excuse me.

90
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,260
He's my friend, thank you for your kindness.

91
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,970
Okay then, ciao!

92
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,020
Oh, did I bother you?

93
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,650
I saw that you were having trouble...

94
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,140
O... Orsola?

95
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,020
Yes.

96
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,280
Why are you at a place like this?

97
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,120
Well, I'm here for the trip of seven days and five nights to Northern Italy, but I got kind of...

98
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,580
Besides that, why are you here?

99
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,920
I thought you were in London.

100
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,630
I've been here for several days now.

101
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:19,920
When I converted from the Roman Church to the Anglican Church, it got a bit unorganized.

102
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:27,880
I still have a lot of my belongings here, but everyone from the Amakusa organization is kindly helping me with my moving.

103
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,310
By Amakusa organization, do you mean <i>the</i> Amakusa?

104
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,110
By the way, were you in the middle of shopping?

105
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,900
Eh?

106
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,480
No, well...

107
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,320
I made it here together with Index,

108
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,360
but she disappeared somewhere...

109
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,640
Meeting you here must be a twist of fate.

110
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,080
You came at the right time!

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,910
Can I ask you to help me with my belongings?

112
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,710
Eh?

113
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,040
Uhh no, as I said-

114
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,000
I need to look for Index.

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Oh, if you're looking for Index-san, then...

116
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,870
Touma! Touma! Touma!

117
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,510
Touma, I didn't know that this place's gelato is this delicious!

118
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,050
Yet it's so cheap!

119
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,680
Yummy!

120
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:19,530
I spotted her stuck to the window of a gelato specialty shop.

121
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:25,200
She asked a good friend of mine and was brought to my house earlier.

122
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,320
You...

123
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,160
You left me behind...

124
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,650
Oh Orsola, when will lunch be ready?

125
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:33,330
Yes, it will be ready soon.

126
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,620
Yay!

127
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,800
Such misfortune...

128
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,220
So, this must be the one the acting Pope has taken interest in...

129
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,620
However, his true abilities might be different.

130
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,620
You're questioning that because you weren't involved in the rescue of Orsola-sama.

131
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:55,850
Apparently, he went head on against the Frontline Sisters of the Roman Church on his own, unarmed!

132
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:01,630
He also seems to have seen the Priestess in the nude and has been slammed by Shichitenshichitou's sheath.

133
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,350
However, he didn't even require any medical care after that!

134
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,950
Monster...

135
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,810
What's with this overly twisted evaluation here...?

136
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,060
Amazing!

137
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,580
This looks so delicious!

138
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,080
But is this okay?

139
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,710
We haven't helped you with the moving yet.

140
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,090
Taking care of you comes first.

141
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,340
Then, without reservation...

142
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,580
Will you use it?

143
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,270
Thank you.

144
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,270
You're welcome.

145
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,400
Itsuwa. So how was the wet towel plan?

146
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,270
Idiot!

147
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,070
It's still too early to jump to conclusions!

148
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:49,030
We have to proceed carefully.

149
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,780
But aren't we starting a bit far off-

150
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,100
Won't we have lunch with them?

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,580
It seems they have to take their meals iin a pre-defined manner due to their training.

152
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,210
Touma!

153
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,360
Now, now, eat it while it's still warm.

154
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,680
Well then,

155
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,210
thanks for the food!

156
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,260
Yummy!

157
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,010
What is this?

158
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,770
How does pasta taste this good?

159
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,630
Somehow, this tastes 500 times better than what Touma usually makes!

160
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,770
You're really not one to speak,

161
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,440
but since this tastes so delicious I'ill let your comment slide!

162
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,900
Yummy!

163
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,820
By the way,

164
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,640
is the destination of your trip Venetia?

165
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:32,240
Well, kind of.

166
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,600
We can't seem to contact with the guide there...

167
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,130
You really should visit Venetia.

168
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,670
The Metropolis of Water, the Goddess of the Adriatic Sea.

169
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,630
As many people would describe with plentiful words, it's a very beautiful city.

170
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,580
I guess we should take a look around, Index.

171
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,930
Wuff oof... Duff...

172
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:56,540
What are you saying?

173
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,560
There we are...

174
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,830
Are we packing the plates next?

175
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,460
Orsola, where's the newspaper stock again?

176
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,790
It's over here.

177
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:41,180
That voice... and the sound of dripping water in a set...

178
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,090
Wah, Touma!

179
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,240
I'm all dirty now!

180
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,400
Then, why don't you take a shower?

181
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
You must be tired from your journey after all.

182
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,620
That was a close call!

183
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,740
This must be a bathroom trap!

184
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,700
I was about to get caught in a life-threatening situa...

185
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,870
There's a voice coming out from here too!

186
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,090
What is this?

187
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,900
What the hell is happening?

188
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:16,930
The basic theory is, there's only one bathroom.

189
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,390
On one side is the bathroom,

190
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,940
and on the other, it's not.

191
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,680
Damn it!

192
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,130
What's with this unfair situation?

193
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,520
Right... No, left!

194
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,360
No, wait!

195
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,690
I can only hear someone taking a shower from the left, so the correct one must be...

196
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,470
Right!

197
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,050
Gotcha!

198
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,080
At this moment...

199
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,540
I mysteriously had one thought...

200
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,650
Why didn't I come up with something simple like knocking on the door first to check?

201
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,060
E-Excuse me...

202
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,240
So <i>this</i> is the bathroom!

203
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm sorry, Orsola!
So <i>this</i> is the bathroom!

204
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,190
I'm sorry, Orsola!

205
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,280
Some very hot wind came out from a weird rod!

206
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,420
There's a bathroom to the left and the right?!

207
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,110
There are two bathrooms in this apartment?!

208
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,460
Y-Yes...

209
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,850
One for daily use, the other was reserved for religious purposes...

210
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:43,540
But since we're moving out, it is now defunct as a religious cleansing place...

211
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,930
That's just irrational!

212
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,520
A violation!

213
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,770
Touma.

214
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:51,360
Why are you here anyway?

215
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,090
And why don't you apologize after seeing someone naked?

216
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,310
W-Well Index-san, as I said, I was looking for the newspaper-

217
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,030
Such misfortune!

218
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh my...

219
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,110
Well then, I'm counting on you.

220
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,020
Good work you two.

221
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,920
I'm sorry for imposing on you for so long.

222
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,150
What will you do from now on, Orsola?

223
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,150
Do you want to go around with us?

224
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,860
No, no...

225
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,160
Should I really come along with you two who are heading to a hotel now?

226
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,030
Oh my!

227
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,450
There will be too many people...

228
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,740
What?

229
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,910
Too many people?

230
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,520
You don't have to ask and you don't have to know, Index!

231
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,260
Also, I want to go around Chioggia to see it off,

232
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,460
since I've been living in this city for a long time.

233
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,550
Yeah...

234
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,730
And I'd prefer you not to see much of it.

235
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,440
I might show a disgraceful side of myself here and there.

236
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,390
I see.

237
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,570
Well then, if you will excuse me.

238
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:20,320
If an opportunity arises, I'll invite you to my apartment in London.

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,990
Yeah, you too if you happen to be in Japan again.

240
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:27,120
But you might have to clean Touma's room first.

241
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,120
Oh, don't tell me...

242
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,030
This is...

243
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,830
Everyone, watch out!

244
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,570
AATR.
<b>Aim to the right</b>

245
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,220
Orsola?

246
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,700
Oh my...

247
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,350
For Index to use that...

248
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,000
Is this... Magic?!

249
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,220
Yes?

250
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:54,920
Where is it coming from? And how is that person doing it?

251
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:00,970
Touma!

252
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:09,530
ISI, CBI.

253
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,850
<b>Reverse the cutting force back to its source!</b>
ISI, CBI.

254
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,210
What about the sniper?

255
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,860
Don't worry.

256
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,530
He's finished.

257
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,430
Finished? Finished what?

258
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:48,680
The fact he has targeted us from afar means that he's transmitting our every move to our enemies.

259
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:53,700
In that case, my spell interceptor should've gotten to his location.

260
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,210
Abandon the vanguard!

261
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,130
Bring out the escape ship immediately,

262
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,200
we will kill the woman onboard the ship!

263
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,170
Are they the snipers?

264
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,390
W-What is that?

265
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,780
Damn it!

266
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,950
Are you kidding?

267
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,360
For something like this to just jump out from the waterway...!

268
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,360
Orsola, let's climb aboard the ship for now.

269
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,020
Y-Yes...

270
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,500
Is this glass?

271
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,290
No, ice?

272
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,090
Touma! Are you all right?

273
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,240
Hey, Touma!

274
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,930
How can something this big sail in the waterway?

275
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,420
It seems we're getting further away from shore.

276
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,420
Yeah...

277
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,460
Where the hell are we heading?

278
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,550
Find them!

279
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,550
They must be around here!

280
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,100
What should we do?

281
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,890
They're looking for us.

282
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,890
I know.

283
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:24,340
But I guess jumping off to escape from here is out of question.

284
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,360
Let's hide somewhere and wait for a chance to escape for now.

285
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,530
Touma...

286
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,590
Damn it.

287
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:47,210
What's going on?

288
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,550
Let's go.

289
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,180
Sorry to intrude.

290
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:21,670
Why did they have to use such outrageous means to attack me?

291
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:25,500
Those guys were wearing robes similar to yours, Orsola.

292
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,190
Yes, it is probably appropriate to consider that they are working for the Roman Church.

293
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,820
That means they're probably involved with the Book of the Law?

294
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:41,390
That issue should have been dealt with when I moved to the Anglican Church.

295
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,730
So this ship is not the stronghold of our enemy,

296
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,550
but a small part of it?

297
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,380
They probably couldn't deploy them all in Chioggia due to the lack of space.

298
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,830
Is Index okay?

299
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,600
I can still use my cell phone, but...

300
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,330
Damn it. I knew she wouldn't turn her cell phone on.

301
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,610
Actually, will there even be a signal here?

302
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,230
I wonder...

303
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,190
The door-!

304
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,780
This is bad!

305
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,330
Hide somewhere, Orsola!

306
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,410
But where?

307
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,680
Gosh! Like this!

308
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,700
For now, I should close the doo-!

309
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,170
Agnese!

A horrible plan that makes use of Agnese?

313
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:30,670
In the secret organization, the Queen of the Adriatic Sea.

314

What? Tatemiya? You and the rest of the Amakusa!

When science and magic cross, the story begins.
