1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:09,380
Croce di Pietro is a troublesome item which can be used regardless of place or season.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,780
If nothing is done about it, the Academy City will be taken under the control of the Roman Catholics, they say?

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,110
I wouldn't ever let that happen!

4
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,420
<b>Croce di Pietro</b>

5
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,430
My, your head was positioned so perfectly.{the head was at a good position.}

6
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,030
Damn it...!

7
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
It's getting darker now.

8
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,170
Isn't it about time to go home?

9
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,260
Or would you rather spend an exciting night together with me?{yes yes yes}

10
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,300
One more...

11
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,270
If I had one more thing...{stop using vlc retard}

12
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,350
Just one more...

13
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,910
Its name is annihilation,

14
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,530
Its purpose is a sword,

15
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,460
Appear, shatter my body, and become power!

16
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,040
Innocentius!

17
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,350
Here we go, Innocentius!

18
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,350
Fortis931...

19
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,980
Here we shall prove that my name depicts the strongest!{hmmm sounds funny}

20
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,150
Die together!

21
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,320
That was dangerous, idiot!

22
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,700
Oh no-

23
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,810
Ashes {return }to ashes,

24
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,950
dust{return } to dust,

25
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:54,340
Vampire Slaying Crimson Cross!

26
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,960
Go home, you incompetent{fail} magician!

27
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,090
Shut up, uber noob{newb}!

28
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,390
Innocentius!

29
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,520
You're in my way!

30
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,400
No, you're in my way!

31
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,280
What the heck is this?

32
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,070
I can't see what they would do next this way{like this}.

33
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,420
A standard,

34
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,710
I want a universal standard...

35
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,750
A clear cut rule,

36
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,640
making everyone happy,

37
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,890
so that no difference in perspectives would cause any tragedy...

38
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,970
For that brilliant world...

39
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,600
That's why I'm going to win.

40
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,390
By winning, I will create the answer.

41
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,280
I am...

42
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,980
My name is Basis104.

43
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,030
Get down{Duck}, noob!

44
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,000
Stiyl!

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,370
Where are you going?

46
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,790
You're supposed to be dealing with me over here.

47
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,970
Enough of this{You've done enough}!

48
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,130
How many do you have to hurt until you're satisfied{fulfilled}?

49
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,890
I don't want to hurt anyone either.

50
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,270
But I have a {purpose}goal.

51
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,900
Now come.

52
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,950
If I screw you, then my job is finished.{no one thought this line seemed troll worthy?}

53
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,700
The rest of it will be accomplished by the Croce di Pietro,

54
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,800
then the Roman Catholics will create a world I desire.

55
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,040
What is your {purpose}goal?

56
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,170
Being in a position of having others choose your future,

57
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,460
quit talking like you're some great person.

58
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,060
Letting others choose, you say?

59
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,420
Right.

60
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,010
I don't mind whoever it is.

61
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,670
As long as someone puts together all the ideals and principles in this world,

62
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,840
I would then defend that standard no matter what.

63
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,980
Is that your {purpose}goal?

64
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,980
I don't understand all these complicated issues.

65
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:27,860
But I can't answer a stupid request like handing over all the people in the Academy City for this goal of yours.

66
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,240
You can make remarks like that because you don't know anything.

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,080
By only being able to stand in disbelief to the situation you're put in,

68
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,720
you've not seen someone with{one having} that expression before.

69
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,540
Because you've never heard that one line, "I'm mortified".

70
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,630
Even so{still},

71
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,170
{There is no justification for you to just freely attack Academy City!}That's a terrible way to justify you freely attacking Academy City.

72
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:55,090
You can't change that argument into logic, {that you should}so you can use someone as a stepping stone for another!

73
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,770
It will never be!

74
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,350
The problems you face are felt by everyone!

75
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,370
Everyone would mess up, and trip at times.

76
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,780
But you know...

77
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,440
{You can stand up again if you fall.}If you fall, you can stand back up.

78
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,070
Even if it's awkward,

79
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,830
even if all your efforts seem to be counterproductive,

80
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,210
you just have to stand back up!

81
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,080
Don't give up on other people's lives!

82
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,380
Which do you choose,

83
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,460
Oriana Thomson?

84
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,590
Will you leave everything to someone else just because you failed once?

85
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,050
Or will you lend your hand again, even if those people have failed before?

86
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,140
I will {put an }end it with this.

87
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,650
I call upon all my ability within this {my }body,

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,650
release them all, and strike the enemy in front of me!

89
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,350
Damnit!

90
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,150
Geez.

91
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,940
Can't you put any effort into trying to make this festival successful?

92
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,320
I have something that I thought of.

93
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,900
Come with me.

94
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,820
Don't expect much.

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,830
This is not my specialty either.

96
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,330
Go on, Kamiyan...

97
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,870
Everyone was trying to protect the present.

98
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,250
I will return to your hospital room before the Night Parade ends.

99
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,400
So make sure you'll wait for me.

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,840
That was how I showed my determination.

101
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:02,050
How could I let that be put to waste here?!

102
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,870
Stiyl!

103
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,500
I'm fine.

104
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,590
More importantly, go for the Croce di Pietro.

105
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,570
Make Oriana say the location.

106
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,350
Stop that ceremonial item from activating{taking effect}{whatever we used last episode?}.

107
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,730
There's no need to worry.

108
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,730
Since everything will end very soon.

109
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,230
Lidvia Lorenzetti...

110
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,040
In no time, the Croce di Pietro will activate{go into effect}.

111
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,400
Academy City will be edited to a part of our Roman Catholic Church.

112
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,670
So you're saying people who are uncooperative like us will be deleted here?

113
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:10,420
{We only say that we will sympathize with the wounds you've received and will shall heal them too.}We say that we'll sympathize with your pain and heal your wounds.

114
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,210
But of course, that's only if we judge it to be beneficial to the Roman Catholic Church.

115
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,380
What did you say?

116
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,170
Don't try to have a serious discussion with her, Kamijou Touma.

117
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,810
Lidvia should be close by.

118
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,640
The ceremonial item would be there as well.

119
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,020
I will tell you, just to prevent any misunderstanding.

120
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,980
The Croce di Pietro is currently not in{ the} Academy City.

121
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,600
What?

122
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:40,910
The Holy See{Papal Territory} created by the Croce di Pietro was 47,000 square kilometers at its greatest time.

123
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,370
Even if I were to release it from outside{ the} Academy City,

124
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,200
it would completely cover the city area without trouble.

125
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,380
They got us...

126
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,850
Oriana was a decoy{ plot}.

127
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,840
It's a pity that she was taken down.

128
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:59,380
But that too would be changed by the Croce di Pietro to something more beneficial for us.

129
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,990
What's important to us, is only one thing: Science yielding to Religion.

130
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,930
By denying science and showing our power,

131
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,390
the authority of our Lord will be restored.

132
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,810
Search and attack,

133
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,940
It would be impossible for Tsuchimikado to use magic twice at this point.

134
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,820
Damn it.

135
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,990
Then, what can we do?

136
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:24,620
We won't destroy{ the} Academy City.

137
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,290
After making you discard the pagan religion by the name of Science,

138
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,330
you will be converted to brothers and sisters that would be loved-

139
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,870
You go call Tsuchimikado.

140
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,590
Find Lidvia's position using Senjutsu Enjin.

141
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,250
If I use my communication spell and let the units outside deal with it...

142
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,630
No use.

143
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:43,880
{Until the world is changed by the Croce di Pietro,}The world will be changed by the Croce di Pietro in approximately...

144
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,890
107 more seconds.

145
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,800
{It's }Checkmate.

146
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,020
Isn't there anything else?

147
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,560
Like some final trump card to reverse this situation?

148
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:59,650
A spell that uses the stars in the night sky...

149
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:01,610
Collecting the light of the stars on the ground,

150
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,330
Tsuchimikado,

151
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:15,250
how many points are there outside {the }Academy City which could become usage points for the Croce di Pietro to encompass the whole city?

152
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,630
What do you say? { I said VLC sucks penis}

153
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,960
Shut up and answer!

154
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,140
Which point is the furthest with that criterion?

155
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,300
The outskirts north of Academy City,

156
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,510
about 1700m.

157
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,050
What does that have to do?

158
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,310
Just twenty more seconds...

159
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,820
It's already over.{It's the end now.}

160
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,580
Sure, it's the end.

161
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,080
If the result is like this, I'm finished.

162
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,630
Hey, don't you agree, Lidvia?

163
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,760
Even if I succeed in destroying your illusion,

164
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,470
if I'm not able to keep a promise with my classmate...

165
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:09,720
What are you saying?

166
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:32,660
The current time here is 6:30 PM, sharp.

167
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,950
You didn't know?

168
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,420
It's the time when the Night Parade begins.

169
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,250
With this amount of light, it can color up the sky well enough to block out the stars.{needs rewording}{With this amount of bright light (its fireworks so it colors the night sky)}

170
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,090
No matter where you are...

171
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,850
14:00 Triathlon - 14:30 Ball Throwing
15:00 Shoulder Wars - 16:30 Ladle run
 17:00 Tug of War - 17:30 1800m mixed gender relay
18:30 Night Parade - 20:00 Closing Ceremony

172
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,970
You lost to the light everyone made to defend the Daihaseisai.
14:00 Triathlon - 14:30 Ball Throwing
15:00 Shoulder Wars - 16:30 Ladle run

18:30 Night Parade - 20:00 Closing Ceremony

174
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,230
You should have put in some research on who the leading roles were in the Daihaseisai.

175
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,490
What are you going to do now?

176
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:08,630
If you say that you will destroy the Croce di Pietro, and would never lay hands on{ the} Academy City,

177
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,040
I'm fine with that.

178
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,960
Are you seriously saying that?

179
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,700
I guess you've forgotten that I'm a devout Roman {Christian}Catholic.

180
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,410
I see.

181
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:29,680
If that's the case, we should have a game of chase to exemplify how an athletic event should truly be.

182
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,260
Lidvia Lorenzetti.

183
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,190
And?

184
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:48,950
So you never told me once, but you participated in a magic battle that could decide{decisive of} the fate of this world and{ the} Academy City,

185
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,660
{and you} were beaten up big time, and brought to the hospital?

186
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:57,990
But Index-san, you would carelessly walk into the center of the incident if you heard anything about magic.

187
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,080
Touma, you're making me sound like a big idiot!

188
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,170
Since you don't realize it yourself, you must be a true-

189
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,250
Oh my.

190
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,220
This is a funny scene.

191
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,940
We're in the middle of a serious discussion, so don't interfere, short hair!

192
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:23,810
Kuroko,

193
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,900
if I remember correctly, commoners can cooperate in Judgment's social order restoration activities, right?

194
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,860
Onee-sama,

195
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,580
please refrain from doing that in the hospital...

196
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,870
Damn it!

197
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,450
Fine then.

198
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,460
Did you see the final results for today?

199
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,040
Our school is at the top, surpassing your school with ease.

200
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,130
Don't say you forgot about the punishment game.

201
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,500
You talk of a punishment game, but I can't participate in events injured like this...

202
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:54,890
Then...

203
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,550
You can try hard and put your life on the line{, risking your life}.

204
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,980
Ah, how pitiful it is for Oriana Thomson.

205
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,860
I have to save them,

206
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,450
the wandering sinners trapped there with my very own hands...

207
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,570
Uhm, attention please~

208
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,920
This is Laura Stuart, archbishop of the Anglican Church.

209
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,960
Did I have to introduce myself like that for you to realize?

210
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,630
I hope you're not cold like that, young miss Lidvia.{cold as in... inhumane, unfriendly}

211
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,340
How did you find out about this private jet?

212
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:38,590
I had them paste one on the aircraft parked in Haneda airport.

213
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,880
You're creepy as usual.

214
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:47,690
That personality of yours, when you laugh crazily like that the more it means you're cornered.{TLC pweeease}{That personality of yorus}

215
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:50,070
Can't you do something about it?

216
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:54,770
The more difficult the situation, the greater the happiness will be when it's overcome.

217
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:58,030
I must thank my Lord.

218
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,250
What's wrong?

219
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,710
The higher the wall, the greater the happiness will be when you surpass it.

220
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:16,050
Sure, that's logical in one sense, I thought.

221
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,010
You bastard on the cliff edge!

222
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,740
Lidvia,

223
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,950
If you discard the teachings of Rome and lick my feet, I can save you.

224
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:48,170
What nonsense do you speak of?

225
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,170
I see.

226
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,460
Then make a crater together with that.

227
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,130
Croce di Pietro?

228
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,760
I won't let you do that!

229
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,850
With my current speed{At the speed now}, I will make it.

230
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:05,850
No, I will surely make it in time.

231
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,470
It will be very close.

232
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,980
But that's what makes it fun!

233
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,070
So Lidvia, which will you choose?

234
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,320
A Ceremonial Item classed as the greatest{ at the greatest class} in this world,

235
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,490
or one pitiful wandering sheep?

236
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,090
The greater the difficulty of the trial,

237
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:41,010
when you overcome it, you will have a greater happiness in trampling me, who created the challenge.

238
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,390
Trample?

239
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:48,890
Over that great flower, as much as I want...

240
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,290
It's shaken quite immensely.{wut}{There has been some great fluctuation}

241
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,420
The growth of the Imagine Breaker who would become the key is still unstable.

242
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,460
Would this become of use or not?{wat}{theres something up on screen so... I think he means if that item? is useful or not}

243
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:27,930
Maybe I have to think of the possibility for me to take action in person.

244
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,530
What are you doing here?

245
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,320
I was sleeping on the bench in the lobby.

246
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,790
They said I can't use it when morning comes, so...

247
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,660
A nice and soft bed...

248
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,050
Are you all right now?

249
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:02,580
Yes, according to what the Frog doctor said, I can leave tomorrow or the day after.

250
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,310
Aisa, you look somewhat lonely.

251
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,470
Why is that?

252
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,110
Was that person doing something reckless again?

253
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,510
Yes, he was.

254
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,030
Oh right, I haven't heard the details yet, but...

255
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:27,480
It was something like the Roman Catholic magicians taking advantage of the Daihaseisai to invade us.

256
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,750
And then Touma ran off on his own without consulting me again.

257
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,750
He then went on a huge rampage on his own,

258
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,000
and told me like he made a report all after it happened.

259
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,990
It's unforgivable, right?

260
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,050
I see.

261
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,260
He didn't care who it was.

262
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,100
He will help anyone that's in trouble.

263
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,430
Even if it isn't me.

264
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,980
Maybe I shouldn't have been helped.

265
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:00,470
I might only be trouble to everyone.

266
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,640
Of course, that's wrong.

267
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,320
Since it seems like Touma is happy when he's together with Aisa.

268
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,380
Fukiyose-san, how can you slap someone after coming to visit their hospital room?

269
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,790
Shut up!

270
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,090
Anyone would be surprised if they suddenly see a man naked!

271
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,300
It was you who entered while I was changing.

272
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,220
What did you say?

273
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,310
Do you know why that person fights?

274
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,190
Who knows?{Saa?}

275
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:35,150
The last time I asked that, he said it was for him or something.

276
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:38,600
For Touma, that must be happiness.

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,510
Huh? Orsola?

284
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,000
The Amakusa-style are here as well?
