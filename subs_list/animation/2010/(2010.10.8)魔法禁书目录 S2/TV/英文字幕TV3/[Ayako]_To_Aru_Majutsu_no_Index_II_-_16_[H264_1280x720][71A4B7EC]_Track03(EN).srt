00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
{Toaru Majutsu no Index II 16}

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,560
Come forth, one of the twelve Apostles!{R: consider exchanging "one" with "member"}

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,980
Watch out!

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,200
Sister Angelene!

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,860
Sister Angelene!

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,910
Jeez.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,790
Don't show me stuff that angers me from the bottom of my heart!

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,500
Use this.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,840
This is...?

10
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,260
It's something called the semi-sub for evacuation.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,630
It's better than staying in the middle of enemy territory.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Sister Lucia...

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,690
Your hands are shaking.

14
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,770
Of course they are.

15
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,690
Stop it.

16
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,980
It's not like I'm going to die here.

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,900
We're all going home together, right?

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,720
With Sister Agnese, and the ones fighting over there...

19
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,180
In reality, we will all go together...

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,600
If that's the case, then I will not die.

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,540
So please.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,910
Can you fight with us in order to protect everyone?

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,030
You better say so, Lucia.

24
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,020
If I can help you with that, I am willing to break all these boring illusions as much as you want.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,690
Then you better say so!

26
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,770
At least, one phrase that would make her think she's happy to be here.

27
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,410
A phrase that can make her believe it was worth all the pain.

28
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,170
Yes.

29
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,030
I will make sure to protect everyone.

30
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,280
So please, fight with confidence as well.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,730
<b>The Rosario of the Timelimit</b>

32
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,970
Has it not sunk yet?
<b>The Rosario of the Timelimit</b>

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,310
<b>The Rosario of the Timelimit</b>

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,570
Jeez, I can't believe we're going through so much trouble just to destroy one city.

35
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,100
Sheesh, that face.

36
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,570
It's so unbearable...

37
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,370
You have an expression that indicates you're still expecting someone to help you even now.

38
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,330
What am I going to rely on, you say?

39
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:26,250
I will crush your hopes right here.

40
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,880
Emotions are not needed in parts.

41
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,100
Go!

42
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,130
Go save her no matter what it takes!

43
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,090
Let's go Index, Orsola!

44
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,730
It seems that no one is here.

45
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,780
It's probably this ship magically controlling all the other ships.

46
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,090
So that's why the sisters aren't coming after us.

47
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,610
Just wait, I'm going to try and unlock this here.

48
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,700
I'm getting really tired of having to think over so many things!

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,790
What the heck is this?

50
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,500
It's a block structure.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,840
Unlike the assistant ship,

52
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,710
This ship probably holds some kind of magical meaning in its entirety.

53
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,640
It's that armor from earlier, right?

54
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,840
Shit!

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,600
Get inside!

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,260
Eh? Hey, wait!

57
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:33,200
You guys go first!

58
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:34,650
Touma!

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,500
Sister Angelene, are you all right?

60
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,870
Yes, I'm fine.

61
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,620
But how can I get through with this situation?

62
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,880
Jeez, so boring.

63
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,170
Quit playing against the injured.

64
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,630
Damn it, a dead end?

65
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,970
This is?

66
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,570
Uhh, they're here again!!

67
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,780
Is it over?

68
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,910
It's connected.

69
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,760
Is this Orsola?

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:38,000
Touma, is it really true that a different spell called the Rosario of the Timelimit, is needed for the Queen of Adriatic Sea to execute?

71
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,960
I hear so, but...

72
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,610
In the 103,000 books I have, there are no notes of that.

73
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,640
Then, what kind of spell is it?

74
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,100
I think it's like an internal code name for a plan only understood among the Roman Catholics.

75
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,530
That right hand...

76
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,890
Do you envy it?

77
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,600
I can't accept it.

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,580
Denying the blessings of the Lord.

79
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,800
That characteristic is bad enough, but even worse, you wield it as a weapon.

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,890
If you had ever heard the Lord's words,

81
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:34,230
you should have tried to tear your arm off in order to obtain His blessings.

82
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,900
But in the end, his words can't get through to an infidel monkey like you!{Uhhh}

83
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,400
Then I, Biaggio Busoni, will put an end to the enemy of the Lord.

84
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,740
So you must be Biaggio.

85
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,780
Then you should know where Agnese is.

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,950
Knowing it and telling you are entirely different things, you know?

87
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:58,470
The Cross signifies disapproval of evil deeds.

88
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:16,650
The Cross also has a purpose of removing external enemies and making a safe area within.

89
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,100
Like this.

90
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:28,580
The Cross also has a characteristic of fixing human arrogance through its weight.

91
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,240
Again, it's like this.

92
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,620
This is?

93
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,270
Hey, don't destroy too much of it.

94
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,520
It will have an effect on controlling the ship over there.

95
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,130
Over there, you say?

96
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,560
The Rosario of the Timelimit.

97
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,890
I won't let you say you don't have any idea, especially after you've come this far.

98
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,810
Whatever it is. If I crush you and pull Agnese out, it's the end.

99
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,100
Showing intent to go against the Lord's will...

100
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,270
Evil words.

101
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,610
My cross will not accept such evil deeds!

102
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,340
Asshole.{Something is obviously missing here.}

103
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,910
You think you have some special privilege to do whatever you want to Venice?

104
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,950
That's not my purpose.

105
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:20,930
What?

106
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:26,040
It's much more interesting than what you imagine, at least.

107
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,750
Most important for the Christians, and the oldest usage,

108
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,280
what do you think it is?

109
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,430
Huh?

110
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,530
It's an execution item.

111
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,520
Simon will carry the cross of the Child of God.{add of the child of the god}

112
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,190
What the hell...

113
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,910
The Cross signifies disapproval of evil deeds.

114
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,200
This is..?

115
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,540
Defense spells are weaved in.

116
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,170
CAH{target all to this direction}

117
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,420
<b>Target all to this direction</b>
CAH{target all to this direction}

118
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:12,430
<b>Target all to this direction</b>

119
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,840
You go save Agnese!

120
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,470
I will lure them all to me!

121
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,720
Index-san?

122
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,290
Orsola Aquinas?

123
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,670
I'm glad that you're unharmed.

124
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,540
Why?

125
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,740
You wanted to escape so badly from the Queen's Fleet.

126
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:45,540
You should fully understand what the situation is like now.

127
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,380
If anyone knew, they would have never said that they would want to escape from this place.

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,360
Leaving without you, who kept silent to save the others, all by themselves...

129
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,390
It's weird.

130
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:03,230
You do remember what I did concerning the Book of the Law.

131
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:06,600
How can you forget it all? After all I had done to you!

132
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,080
I don't know the answer.

133
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,530
However, at the very least, Lucia-san and Angelene-san clearly stated that they wanted to save you.

134
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,920
Even after they saw a hopeless situation,

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,550
where countless blades were put up against them.

136
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:28,880
They still told us they wanted to smile all together.

137
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,040
Do you still think their words aren't enough?

138
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,510
Don't trouble me, Sister Agnese.

139
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,770
Even if you die here, the plan will not be halted.

140
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,270
However, it's just time-consuming to find a different suitor.

141
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,690
I hate troublesome things.

142
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,830
That blood is...?

143
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,610
I said I hate troublesome things.

144
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,960
So I quickly crushed him off.

145
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,630
I'd rather not have you do that here.

146
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,340
I can't have you carelessly scar it.

147
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,430
Counter Venetia Large Scale Magic Spell.

148
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,130
Why use something like that now?

149
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:25,230
What we are trying to use is not a counter state attack magic.

150
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,430
It's something on{at} a higher level.

151
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,900
"The Queen of the Adriatic Sea" is a spell made only to be used against Venetia.

152
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,770
Regardless of how wonderful the destructive power it has,

153
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:39,610
unless its target restriction is removed, it's useless.

154
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,240
Then why?

155
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:44,320
So you noticed?

156
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,880
I will remove the limit from "The Queen of the Adriatic Sea".

157
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,210
To do so, the Rosario of the Timelimit is needed.

158
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:57,680
Are you saying you'll destroy a city that you consider to be in your way?

159
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,720
"The Queen of the Adriatic Sea" destroys everything that had to do with the City.

160
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,020
What do you think will happen if we fire the same thing against the city that leads the enemy organization?

161
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,810
You can't be thinking of Academy City!

162
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,580
All the science and technology is affected by Academy City.

163
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:30,330
If we were to destroy it all in one night, we'd be able to annihilate the side that annoyingly covers half of the world.

164
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,420
Do you think everyone would be happy with that?

165
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,840
I don't.

166
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,960
There are those who are malevolent within the Magic side as well.

167
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,300
But we can continue doing it.

168
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,550
All impurities will be filtered out sooner or later.

169
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,420
You are-

170
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,850
That is our ultimate wish.

171
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,390
Of our Roman Catholic Church.

172
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,390
The Cross signifies unacceptance of evil deeds!

173
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:00,210
Quit it, Sister Orsola.

174
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,900
The Cross corrects the arrogance through its weight!

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,370
So even though it's a little early, shall we begin, Sister Agnese?

176
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,540
Be happy.

177
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:20,380
You will have the honor of destroying {having destroyed}the most enemies in the history of Christianity!

178
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,060
Within the enemies you speak of,

179
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,940
isn't Agnese-san included as well?

180
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,350
It seems you're now really a part of the Anglican Church.

181
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,360
That's why you're so desperate.

182
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,860
The only motivation for you to act must be the suspicion of others.

183
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:43,490
You cannot understand how people can be motivated through desires.

184
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,160
No, you can understand it, but you do not believe it!

185
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,370
Get out of the way.

186
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,040
In no way you can stop Biaggio.

187
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,120
If you don't resist, you probably won't die.

188
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,710
There's no way I can do that.

189
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,380
It's the end, Sister Orsola.

190
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,180
Smile, Sister Agnese.

191
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,930
Watch your dreams be shattered.

192
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,470
What was that?

193
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,820
Correspondence to the Fifth of the Five Elements,

194
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,650
signifying peace and order,

195
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,150
Deploy the crosier!

196
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,070
Sister Agnese!

197
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:30,000
I am asking what you are doing!?

198
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:32,740
It's what you doubt!

199
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,590
It must all be wrong.

200
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,770
Someone like me wanting to take care of people like Sister Lucia and Sister Angelene.

201
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:48,840
Also, the rage from thinking of the sisters fighting because of your shit-like orders.

202
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,260
Quit saying stupid things!

203
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,900
Heretic!

204
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,360
Simon will carry the Cross of the Lord's child.

205
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:17,630
If I recall correctly, God's child did not have any strength left to carry the Cross.

206
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,130
Simon carried the Cross in place of him to the execution hill.

207
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,210
Am I wrong?

208
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,170
So you noticed?

209
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,320
The true form of this attack is having the weight of the equipment be put onto another!

210
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,350
You probably collected the weight of the equipment of those working here,

211
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,980
and you convert that into attacking power.

212
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,600
Something like that I assume?

213
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,080
With such weak hands...

214
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,240
Try with a stronger arm.

215
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,440
You think so?

216
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,860
Then it will be fine with a right hand like this?

217
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,750
Why you...

218
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,910
Infidel monkey!

219
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,340
At least check if you find a corpse, you idiot.

220
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,040
My right hand isn't as easy as you believe it is!

221
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,460
Too late!

222
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,630
As if I'd take the same attack!

223
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,600
Agnese!

224
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,150
Y-Yes?

225
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,860
Thank you!

226
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,490
If you hadn't protected Orsola, things would have probably turned out very badly.

227
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,080
Oh, my.

228
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,410
And...

229
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,180
What do I have to do to destroy all of "The Queen of the Adriatic Sea"?

230
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,730
Well, I hear only this room is irreplaceable.

231
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,760
If we could completely destroy the function of this room...

232
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,800
Never again will...

233
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:58,930
Agnese!

234
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,070
Agnese!

235
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:06,860
What's wrong?

236
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,560
The Rosario of the Timelimit?

237
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
That must be it!

238
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,070
Did you do something to Agnese-san through her ceremonial item?

239
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,790
It's useless without proper adjustments.

240
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,510
But the power itself is already here.

241
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,760
Because the Roman Catholics feared having this stolen and aimed against itself,

242
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,480
we put many modifications to it.

243
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,520
Then, when it gets into enemy hands,

244
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,930
what do you think was prepared as the final solution?

245
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,140
Self destruct?

246
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:05,550
This is a large scale magic apparatus that has been replenished by the sinners in this place.

247
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,500
Don't you think it can be stopped just by crushing the walls or the floors.

248
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,670
If the spell goes out of control,

249
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,290
its explosive power should have at least a 10km radius.

250
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:17,970
If that happens, it would cause damage to the shores too!

251
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:20,210
Agnese!

252
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:26,270
Orsola, take Agnese and leave first.

253
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,530
Make the Amakusa people pull out!

254
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,360
But, what about you?

255
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,020
I have to stop him, right?

256
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,450
I will certainly join up later.

257
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,360
So, go on.

258
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:35,940
Orsola!

259
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
No way!

260
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,000
Certainly, you certainly must!

261
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,580
That bastard!

262
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,040
What enormously great task that'll be in the history of the Roman Catholic was this?

263
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,220
That's why I said it was too quick.

264
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm finished already.

265
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,810
So that's why you'll involve everyone else as well?

266
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:07,390
What you're doing now is just trying to make yourself feel better!

267
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,230
There isn't anyone who wouldn't feel any fear in a situation like this.

268
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,310
This is now a threat to the Roman Catholics.

269
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,700
Everyone would agree with the choice I made.

270
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,830
Give me a moment of greatness at my very end.

271
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,750
To do so, the Adriatic Sea can be screwed.

272
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,610
Biaggio!

273
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,750
That's the face!

274
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,670
That fortitude is a threat to us!

275
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,750
That's why I will make sure you are crushed here!

276
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,830
That's the last attack I will give devoting to the Roman Catholic Church!

277
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,380
Biaggio!

278
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,270
The Cross signifies unacceptance of evil deeds.

279
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,310
The Cross corrects arrogance through its weight.

280
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,310
The Cross signifies unacceptance of evil deeds.

281
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,790
One Sister Agnese is such a meaningful price?

282
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,250
There isn't a place that would accept that woman anymore.

283
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,290
What part of it don't you understand?

284
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,620
You damned infidel monkey!

285
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,580
Hell, I would understand that!

286
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,290
You shithead!

287
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:22,270
The Cross signifies unacceptance of evil deeds.

288
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,720
Biaggio!

289
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,890
The left hand?

290
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:29,680
This bastard!

291
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:33,020
He's using my attack...

292
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,100
I will fight.

293
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,870
If you think of targeting Agnese and the others again,

294
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,780
I will resist against you as many times as I need.

295
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,480
Touma! Touma~!

296
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,740
Are you awake now?

297
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,370
The Adriatic Sea wasn't too cold, was it?

298
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,450
Why do you seem so happy?

299
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,790
Could it be because you weren't left out this time?

300
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,340
I-I'm not happy, really.

301
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,420
Oh Touma, you have a phone call.

302
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,680
Hey you, come back to the Academy City immediately.

303
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,340
Huh?

304
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,110
You see, having your body inspected in a hospital outside is a bit...

305
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:57,070
There should be a supersonic speed passenger plane made by the Academy City parked at the airport.

306
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,730
I-I've only spent one day in Italy!

307
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:04,940
Oh, yes. A girl who visited your hospital room had something she really wanted to tell you.

308
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,150
Expect the punishment for the Daihaseisai after you return home.

309
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,110
Misaka Mikoto!

310
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,830
Hey, let me go!

311
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,580
I don't want to go home!

312
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,800
I see.

313
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,060
Good working.

314
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,050
Well, if you just needed a report on the result, you could have asked the Amakusa.

315
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,760
I am not an Amakusa person anymore.

316
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,480
That being said,

317
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,520
Nee-chin, you caused big trouble to Kami-yan again this time.

318
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,190
This won't be repaid with a day of serving to him in a maid outfit.

319
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,650
Oh, right.

320
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,280
I will lend you a fallen angel maid set.

321
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,980
Go attack him with that!

322
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,580
How ridiculous can you get?!

323
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,500
Do you really have something like that?

324
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,700
Oh?

325
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,710
You're one of the only 20 Saints this world has.

326
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,710
Prepare yourself-!

327
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:17,730
W-What is it? Don't mind...

328
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,940
I'm back.

329
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:29,280
Actually, I got more luggage on the way here.

330
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,330
But really, that was done too hastily.

331
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,590
Who are you telling that to?

332
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,590
Who are you talking to?

333
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,290
Do you have enough understanding?

334
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:51,350
You're the Roman Pope, eh?

335
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,390
What does that have to do?

336
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:56,430
If you show some evil thought against me, you will die!

337
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,480
The Right Seat to God,

338
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,100
I guess being Pope is no match for that.

339
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:05,470
Read this and sign it.

340
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,150
Ordering me?

341
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,820
Wait...

342
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,390
This document is...

343
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:14,030
It's something you would order sooner or later.

344
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,330
<b>Kamijou Touma,
investigate the above stated person,</b>

345
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,710
<b>and make sure you slay him if he is confirmed to be an enemy of our Lord.</b>

The Academy City meets a calm autumn.

349
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,080
One promise slashed through the peaceful days.

350
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,530
What is going to happen?

351
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,000
Next episode: Punishment Game.

352
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,260
When science and magic meet, the story begins.
