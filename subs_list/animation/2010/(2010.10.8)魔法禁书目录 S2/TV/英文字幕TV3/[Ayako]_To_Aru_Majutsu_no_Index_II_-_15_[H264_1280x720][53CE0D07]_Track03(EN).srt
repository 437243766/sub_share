1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,950
Agnese!

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,940
Please hold on!

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,110
Why are you on the Queen of the Adriatic Sea?

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,240
Well...

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,900
It somehow turned out like this with us boarding this ship...

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,740
Is "The Queen of the Adriatic Sea" the name of this ice fleet?

7
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,080
The name of the fleet is "The Queen's Fleet".

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,350
This ship is one of the escort vessels.

9
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,760
It seems you really don't know about anything.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,930
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,970
I was looking for the intruders myself.  {I was aiding on the search for the intruders.<- this is a more accurate tl but it doesnt really fit...}

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,880
But oh well...

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,220
Who would have expected you to be the intruders?

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,270
It appears that I have some use for you.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,470
We were just dragged into this mess!

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:53,850
Keep talking like this and I'll shout.

17
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:58,030
I think it would be best for you not to upset me.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,010
We have no choice but to obey her for now.

19
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,990
What kind of merit would you gain by us escaping?

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,530
A reward... Would be fine if you take it like that.

21
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,840
<b>The Queen's Fleet</b>

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,980
What the hell is the Queen's Fleet in the first place?
<b>The Queen's Fleet</b>

23
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,950
Well, it's a fleet that was created to observe the Adriatic sea.

24
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,080
I've never heard of that before.

25
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,820
Our knowledge about our own Roman Catholics extends only to a small portion.

26
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,520
We were assaulted out of the blue by the people on this ship.

27
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,450
Is this fleet really only designed for observation?

28
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,700
You seem to have been spotted through that observation.

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,120
You're someone who foiled the Roman Catholic Church's project.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,050
Furthermore, one is from Japan, the other from London.

31
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,470
Well, that's just the surface; this is actually a type of prison chamber,

32
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,740
where sinners like myself are gathered to pay for the losses incurred.

33
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,990
Thus the people here are mostly from my squad, or should I say former squad-members.

34
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,230
{So }Let's move{I'm moving} on to the main topic now.

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,630
I shall let you slip by, but in exchange, save Sister Angelene and Sister Lucia from this place.{I want you to save sister Angelene and sister Lucia from here in exchange for me letting you go. }{Edit}

36
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,870
When you say save, you mean...?

37
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,200
Those two attempted a prison break{made an escape out of prison} using a spell to counter against the search.

38
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,950
Both of them intended to rescue us after they'd completed their preparations, but...

39
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,480
So, they were found escaping from prison, taken back, and punished?{Edit}{They probably split the hat with the prison breaking spell. }

40
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,850
I would imagine they were given anti-prison breaking spells.

41
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,580
They would be given modifications so that they could never use that same spell again.

42
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,200
Modifications?

43
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:29,700
By removing their cognitive ability?

44
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,470
In other words, by destroying the neural network in their brains{wtf am i typing}{the structure of their brains}.

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,460
I want you to save them before that happens.

46
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,300
That is what I want{my desire}.

47
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,080
With that, you'll also obtain the spell to get out of here.

48
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,160
But wouldn't that spell have already been discovered by the Roman Catholic Church by now?

49
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,190
The Queen's Fleet has a major job from now on.

50
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,460
They can't be concerned with one or two fugitives.

51
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:58,080
I will head toward the organization to act as a diversion,

52
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,940
so please, do something in the meantime.

53
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,930
Are you going to save us?

54
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,160
I'm not saving you, I'm making use of you two.

55
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,410
Aren't you also being held captive here?

56
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,400
Let's get out of here together.

57
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,000
What the supervisors{people administrating}{controling} fear is mutiny{a revolt of the workers}.

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,110
You could say I am a psychological safety device to prevent that from happening.

59
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,820
I am given freedom to move around the fleet.

60
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm also not obliged labor.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,310
This place is surprisingly comfortable.

62
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,580
Both Sister Angelene and Sister Lucia are needlessly putting themselves in trouble.

63
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,850
They should have just escaped on their own.

64
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,860
If you were to somehow escape by some stroke of luck,

65
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,690
you should never ever get involved with the Roman Catholic Church again.

66
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,920
I understand.

67
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,160
If we go up against large numbers, we won't be able to save them very easily.

68
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:50,830
Is that something a man who faced many sisters all alone in a fight should say?

69
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,670
Th-Thank you.

70
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:12,300
That sister outfit was a special ornament to give magical restraining effects.

71
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,060
If that's the Queen's Fleet,

72
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,700
I can't go all by myself.

73
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,250
No one is here.

74
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,940
Yup, Agnese said it's nearly unmanned{vacant}.{humanless}

75
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,070
So, that must be it -

76
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,400
the room that Lucia and Angelene are in.

77
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:37,800
Huh?

78
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,870
What is that?

79
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,070
What's the matter?

80
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,740
Stand back, Orsola!

81
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,090
Is this armor like some robot that moves with magic?

82
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:02,050
It seems like part of the ship changed form and turned into it.

83
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,070
Freeze!

84
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,520
How do you think I broke this?

85
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,920
Oh my, I went on speaking Japanese, but you understand me, right?

86
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,880
If you don't listen to my warning,

87
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,480
I'll just have to use this.

88
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,710
I've come to help.

89
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,420
Do you think we believe that?

90
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,260
Erm, you see...

91
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,600
From what {we heard from }Agnese told us, you can use magic that would help us leave this place.

92
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,980
{So }That's why she said we should help you and ask for your cooperation.

93
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,890
{Y-You were told by }S-Sister Agnese told you that?

94
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,150
At least consider the possibility that it could be a trap.

95
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,390
This is the enemy's headquarters.

96
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,560
I can't imagine any reason to help you using Agnese's name{the name of Agnese}.

97
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,440
Sister Lucia...

98
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,510
I understand.

99
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,790
Your explanation is at least logical enough.{There is at least minimal logic in your explanation.}

100
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,290
By the way, how do we escape?

101
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,790
Explaining that is too much effort.

102
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,380
Sister Angelene,

103
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,230
Erm...

104
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,110
Amazing...

105
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,640
It's a type of shipbuilding spell that uses ice.

106
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,270
We can make holes.

107
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,250
By applying this magic, we can make a sea bed coaster.

108
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,000
What's wrong?

109
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,440
It looks like they added counterattack spells onto our retention outfit.

110
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,390
If we break the stitches according to proper instructions...

111
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,200
We can break part of the retention effect.

112
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,100
Break?

113
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,630
Then I can quickly-

114
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,230
Oh my, are you going to strip them naked, too?

115
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,620
What's going to happen to us?

116
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,080
I'm more concerned about dinner, today.

117
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,360
What do you mean?

118
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,830
There is nothing more important than our Lord in this world.

119
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,200
I'm concerned, too!

120
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,490
We had olive as a trace ingredient for three days in a row.

121
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:41,350
Also the bath is a little too hot, isn't it?

122
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,670
Trace ingredient{hidden flavor} stuff is not important.

123
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,840
And that bath should be considered a little too lukewarm.

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,260
I-Is that so?

125
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:51,950
The adults don't seem to be that concerned about it.

126
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,160
Then does that make it-

127
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,490
Is anything the matter?

128
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,050
I-If we are going to have a protest, then I will come along!

129
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,900
Well, that might be nice, too, but...

130
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,420
When will we be able to meet up with Sister Agnese?

131
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,890
Sorry.

132
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,040
Agnese probably won't come.{will probably not come.}

133
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,550
She said she was going to distract them{going on a diversion plan} so that we could save you.

134
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,790
She said she will be going to the flagship of The Queen's Fleet.

135
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,260
No kidding!

136
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,160
This Queen's Fleet is used to defend the ceremonial place of the large scale magic spell, The Queen of the Adriatic Sea.

137
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,720
The Queen of the Adriatic Sea?

138
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,260
The only things we know are that it will be performed on the flagship by the same name.

139
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:41,830
As the initiation key, there is a different spell related to it called the Rosario of Timelimit.

140
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:46,340
Also, {for the Rosario of the Timelimit, }Sister Agnese will be used for the Rosario of the Timelimit.

141
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,050
What will happen to Agnese?

142
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:57,270
We don't know the details, but we do know her brain will most likely be destroyed.

143
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,730
She will become an existence with only a beating heart.

144
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,510
The Queen's Fleet has a big task to perform now.

145
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,860
They can't be bothered about one or two fugitives.

146
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,580
Attacks?

147
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,670
From where?

148
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:19,560
No way, from friendly ships?

149
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,960
{intermission}

150
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,860
The divine cannons of Saint Barbara?

151
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,870
Where are you firing them from?

152
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,970
Don't you know, Sister Agnese?

153
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,770
Bishop Biaggio.

154
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,520
Ship 37 has sunk.

155
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,430
Further attacks will cause us to be seen from the shore.

156
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,670
Leave the cover up operations to other departments.

157
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,820
I'm not in charge of that.

158
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:08,760
After all, we can't have anything happen to you, right?

159
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,780
How ironic.

160
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,290
The Rosario of the Timelimit...

161
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,810
Why is an infidel like you the only one fit for it?

162
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,550
Bishop Biaggio, it's an emergency.

163
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,870
What is it?

164
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,550
Sir.

165
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,760
Below the 37th ship, there are signs of a huge structure!

166
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,890
It seems like they are collecting the remains.

167
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,900
An underwater spell?{diving}

168
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,990
Where are Orsola and the others?

169
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,530
This is bad...

170
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,930
I might seriously die this time.

171
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,910
Touma!

172
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,380
Ah, Index?

173
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,250
Are you okay, Touma?

174
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,340
Yeah...

175
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,400
T-Tatemiya Saiji?

176
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,130
Yeah.

177
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:17,010
It's the great Pope-in-Charge of the Amakusa Church.

178
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,560
Although, we are required to put 'A Division of the Anglican Church' before that title.

179
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,830
Huh?

180
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,600
Please.

181
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,760
Oh, thank you.

182
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,040
Don't mention it.

183
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,590
Huh?

184
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,330
Actually, why am I here?

185
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,170
Where are Orsola and the others?

186
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:37,450
We did pick them all up, at least.

187
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,310
I'm questioning the men separately, though...

188
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,270
I see.

189
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,750
And is this building some sort of secret hideout for the Amakusa?

190
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,220
This is no building.

191
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,700
Huh?

192
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,680
Don't tell me it's...

193
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,420
I'd love to call it a submarine,

194
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,020
but it's not that advanced.

195
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,700
It's closer to a wooden ship with underwater capabilities.

196
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,980
It's a semi-sub.{above and underwater ship}

197
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,050
So you brought all this just to help with her moving?

198
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,210
It's natural for us to carry weapons along.

199
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:18,720
After all, what we are most skilled in is naval battle.

200
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,540
Paper is made of wood, and wood makes ships, they say.

201
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,130
Agnese...

202
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,300
Wh-What?

203
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,360
Nothing.

204
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,760
Whatever you do from now on, I have to hear the details first.

205
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,920
Then you should ask Lucia or Angelene-

206
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,860
Oh, what?

207
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,190
You all seem to made it fine.

208
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,730
My, you don't have to be so embarrassed.

209
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,920
Huh?

210
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,440
The sister outfits the two were wearing were restraining uniforms that the Roman Catholics prepared.

211
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,890
While you were unconscious, we used your right hand to destroy them.

212
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,860
That means...

213
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:11,220
Yes, that's what it means.

214
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,500
Touma~!

215
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,220
B-Being raged at for this is...

216
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,640
Unreasonable!

217
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,490
Oh, right.

218
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,640
We don't have time for this.

219
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,190
Umm... Sister Agnese is still...

220
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,920
We have a purpose and...

221
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Please let us explain about Sister Agnese-

222
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,290
Itsuwa, now's the chance!

223
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,100
Give him a kiss on his earlobe!

224
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,980
Please let us explain the situation!

225
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:49,800
Oh my.

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,440
This is getting interesting.

227
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,210
I'm begging you, please listen to me!

228
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,230
Attention!

229
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,450
Sister Angelene...

230
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,040
We were always like this in our squad.

231
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,650
So it was a habit for me...

232
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,870
Usual habit?

233
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,550
I want a chocolate con panna rather than coffee or tea.

234
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,260
What is that?

235
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,710
There's lots of whipped cream on top of the chocolate drink-

236
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,460
Sister Angelene,

237
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,140
A Christian shouldn't be so desperate over food!

238
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,130
Well, well...

239
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,040
Here.

240
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,790
Oh, thank you.

241
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,300
Don't mention it.

242
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,320
You're going with the wet towel plan again, Itsuwa?

243
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,740
Geez, so slow!

244
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,930
No, it's your charm not to progress quickly.

245
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,320
But why is "The Queen of the Adriatic Sea" the name of the spell?

246
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,620
In the past, Venetia and the Roman Catholics were on really bad terms.{is this Venetia or Venice or Venetians?}

247
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:08,620
"The Queen of the Adriatic Sea" was prepared so that they could annihilate Venetia in one strike.{is this Venetia or Venice?}

248
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,960
Annihilate, you mean like bombing?

249
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,080
It doesn't just mean physical destruction.

250
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:18,020
Even its history and culture; all of it will be taken away.

251
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,230
All of it?

252
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:22,380
Sister Agnese probably knows nothing about this.

253
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,380
She would never keep silent if she knew.

254
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:33,560
So you must be telling us to rescue Agnese Sanctis before that magic takes effect, but...

255
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,520
Well it's a really difficult task, eh?

256
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,900
Nevertheless, we have to go.

257
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:43,080
At this rate, Sister Agnese will be as good as dead.

258
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,770
You're telling us just to silently watch that?

259
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:52,620
I was always helped by Sister Agnese, so I could never say goodbye to her without returning the favor.

260
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,590
However, the enemy is troublesome, you know?

261
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,300
If we make a network of sea bed coasters, we might be able to stop the fleet from moving.

262
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,140
I don't think the opponent will be dealt with that easily just by stopping its movement.

263
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,340
Th-That's...

264
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,050
Hey, Tatemiya,

265
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,920
Isn't that enough?

266
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,520
Huh?

267
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:18,540
What we should be discussing is whether we want to help Agnese or not, and nothing more.

268
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,040
She gave up her chance to save herself and tried to save her friends.

269
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,020
At this rate, her feelings will just be taken advantage by others and she will be destroyed.

270
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,930
So we only have to save her, right?

271
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:35,050
Doing that, we can prevent the destruction of Venetia too, right?{is this Venezia or Venice?}

272
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,630
Then we have only one thing we must do.

273
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,290
You don't want to help her?

274
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,440
Then I will go alone.

275
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,710
We've already passed that obstacle.

276
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,290
I already have a plan prepared.

277
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:52,570
Huh?

278
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,560
I just wanted to hear if you were determined or not.

279
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,810
Tatemiya...

280
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,750
Surely as we are going into battle, we will surely come back alive.

281
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,810
The teachings we have received from our Priestess:

282
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,370
A helping hand to those who are in distress.{a hand to save those who are not being saved}

283
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,850
Here, take this.

284
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,010
Oh, my.

285
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,130
Since I can't use it, you should carry it.

286
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,920
Oh, what's wrong, Index?

287
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,000
Nothing.

288
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,770
So then.

289
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:32,860
We shall begin.

290
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,970
Bishop Biagion.

291
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,110
30 to 40 ships approaching!

292
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,380
50 seconds until our ship's position.

293
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,040
Can you sink them?

294
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,700
Understood!

295
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,180
They won't even fire a single round!

296
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,410
It can't be!

297
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,450
All crew, take defensive positions!

298
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,170
What's wrong?

299
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,890
It's a firef.

300
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:05,470
We are facing an unmanned suicide bomber fleet!

301
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:12,650
A huge structure 40m below sea!

302
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,350
It's most likely a semi-sub!{above under water boat}

303
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,940
We've confirmed hits on the semi-sub!

304
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,560
Enemy units detected on the 29th ship!

305
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,430
It's the Amakusa from before!

306
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,740
No way, the semi-sub is just a decoy, as well?

307
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,410
Don't worry about taking control of each of the ships!

308
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,290
We only need to think about destroying the enemy core, right?

309
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:34,240
You head for The Queen of the Adriatic Sea.

310
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,950
Yeah.

311
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:38,990
Hurry!

312
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,000
Index!

313
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,190
This way!

314
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,220
Got it!

315
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,260
You idiots!

316
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,460
Why can't you move to help Sister Agnese?

317
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,610
They fired at us!

318
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,030
They are going to sink us along with the ship!

319
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,310
They are targeting us directly!

320
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:16,830
No way...

321
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,870
Appear, one of the 12 apostles,

322
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,100
being a tax gatherer, the one that destroys magicians, the obscure servant!

323
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,890
Oh no!

324
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,700
Appear, one of the 12 apostles-

325
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,870
Watch out!

326
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,790
Sister Angelene?

327
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:52,030
Sister Angelene!

328
