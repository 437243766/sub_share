1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,390
Mother...?

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,830
But weren't you talking about university and stuff just now?

3
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,820
Yes.

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,890
I'm studying again.

5
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,850
It's stimulating in a lot of ways.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,200
What are your thoughts about it, Touma?

7
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:16,910
How I think... Well you know how we are too...

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:17,660
Huh?

9
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,180
Of course, it's weird!

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,780
Around Touma, there are so many young people it's unnatural.

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,880
From a natural perspective, this is impossible.{But this is impossible, from a natural perspective.}

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,640
Let's put that aside and have some lunch.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,590
I brought a packed lunch, just as a mother should do!

14
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,450
Behold!

15
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,160
Today's menu is Cheese Fondue.

16
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,330
Don't bring dangerous stuff{articles} into the Academy City!

17
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,620
Come on.

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:48,190
Eating in tiny bits from a small packed lunch won't let the nutrients reach the parts that need it the most, right?{most required places}

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,160
Huh?

20
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,320
Just which parts are you talking about?!

21
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,330
Who knows?

22
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,170
I wonder what you meant.

23
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,240
Oh, my.

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,230
You're doing it again, Touya-san?

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,020
Uh, well...

26
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,400
Eat a lot and grow bigger, eh?

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,180
Huh?

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,620
Touma!

29
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,330
Touma~!

30
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,620
Of course, I don't like being bitten, but her acting like this makes me feel uneasy in a different way.

31
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,160
<b>Stab Sword

32
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,410
Here.

33
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,720
Thank you!

34
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,620
Bye!

35
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,060
I should have given orders to prevent any contact with civilians as much as possible.

36
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,730
I'm doing so, as much as I can.

37
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,620
How is it on your side?

38
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,800
Has anyone found you yet?

39
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,780
Rest assured.

40
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,350
Since I'll be keeping a low profile for now.

41
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,680
How elegant.

42
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,690
I'd like to be relaxed too.

43
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,110
Some workout in the hotel would be nice too.{she refers to sex in love hotel}

44
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,700
I've reminded you to stay away from using obscene expressions.

45
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,800
Oh, you're interpreting it incorrectly.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,430
You're so perverted{Such a pervert you are}, Lidvia!{check spelling}

47
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,950
I know about it anyway, but merely waiting sure is tough.

48
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,830
Touma, Touma~!

49
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,420
I think I want to drink the fruit juice that they're selling over there!

50
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,140
You know you had lunch just now.

51
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,730
You'll get fat if you keep eating and drinking like that.

52
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,020
I-I won't!

53
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,590
Oh really?

54
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,030
You might not realize that your defensive barrier{ ability} is secretly increasing.{lol animation fail look at index face}{lol can i use defensive barrier as fat :P}

55
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:22,450
If you don't believe it, then why don't you measure my stomach?

56
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,070
Why would I carry a measuring tape around?

57
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,570
You don't need one!

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,610
Onee-sama!

59
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,810
Onee-sama~!

60
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,230
I-It's cruel to dodge at the very last moment...

61
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,570
Oh, I'm sorry!

62
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,690
I'm in a hurry.

63
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,860
W-What's the matter, Onee-sama?

64
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,020
Don't tell me it's that man... I mean that anthropoid you're going to cheer for.

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,840
I-It's not like that!

66
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,900
I forgot to tell my mother about a change of programs.

67
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,930
Oh really?

68
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,680
But that person seems to be right there though.

69
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,120
Huh?

70
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,940
Maybe she's pregnant?{Maybe she'd just experienced a pregnancy?}

71
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,590
They might {already }be feeling the baby kicking inside.

72
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,960
How dare...

73
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,500
Drop dead, you damned pervert{, begone}!

74
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:30,730
Huh?

75
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,450
What misfortune!

76
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,260
Orsola!

77
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,260
I told you not to eat muffins inside the library!

78
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,450
But the Amakusa-style people made this for me-

79
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,570
Don't scatter crumbs all over the place!

80
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,610
You two seem to have become pretty used to your situation now.

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,270
Thanks to you.

82
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,610
I'm supposed to be a special agent in deciphering codes.

83
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,830
Leave it to me for handling large amounts of information.

84
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,890
Sherry-san, I'm good at deciphering codes as well.

85
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,140
Anyways, the data for the report-

86
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,660
You idiot, I told you not to spill crumbs!

87
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,880
Geez.

88
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:26,110
Since when did Necessarius become so cosy?{unserious}

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,280
Stop!

90
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,760
Smoking is banned on the streets of the Academy City all day!

91
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,210
Don't you know the term "second hand smoke"?

92
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:40,500
Of course, I know.

93
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,220
Huh?

94
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,860
Then why are you lighting a new cigarette?

95
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,570
Hey!

96
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,090
Listen to what I have to say!

97
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,550
Look this way!

98
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,050
Komoe-sensei?

99
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,530
I managed to escape.

100
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,280
Found you.

101
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,300
Good timing.

102
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,530
Oh, Himegami.

103
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,850
There's a bit of a problem.

104
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,570
Come here.

105
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,830
Oh, okay.

106
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,770
Umm...

107
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,880
What's wrong?

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,610
Himegami, you don't seem to mind doing that.

109
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,220
Hey!

110
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,140
That kind of stuff needs to be confiscated!

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,200
Just be obedient and hand that over!

112
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,690
You don't need to stop that.

113
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,590
But...

114
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,660
Oh.

115
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
Hello?

116
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,850
Kami-yan, there's some movement going on.

117
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,940
About three minutes ago, at the Seibusan subway station in the 5th Academy District, we found Oriana.

118
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,640
Where is Stiyl?

119
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,310
He's right here.

120
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,730
Then come to the station with him.

121
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,840
Understood.

122
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,480
Wait, I haven't finished speaking yet!

123
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,000
Himegami!

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,670
I leave the rest to you!

125
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,170
*Grasp*

126
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,140
Hey, what are you doing, Himegami-san?

127
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,970
I need to avoid unnecessary trouble.

128
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,610
Hurry up, Stiyl!

129
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,640
Just two more stations.

130
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,500
Hmm, what are you looking at?

131
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,380
Documents about the Croce di Pietro that were in the English Library.

132
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,280
Did you find out anything?

133
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,570
It's too much of a hassle to actually tell you.

134
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,250
I'll copy the data onto your mobile.

135
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,540
Um, okay.

136
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,550
What?

137
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,250
How am I supposed to read this?!

138
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,220
Tsuchimikado!

139
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,580
Where are you now?

140
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,570
Sorry, the autonomic buses are stuck in a traffic jam.

141
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,500
What's the distance from here to there?

142
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,020
About ten minutes if I run, I guess?

143
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,170
If you take{have} that much time, she would move away from the{leave from} search range!

144
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,500
I know that.

145
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,550
Stiyl.

146
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,450
Would you be able to draw a Rihashijin pattern if I were to give you instructions through the phone?

147
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,410
That would be impossible.

148
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,160
I have no knowledge about Oriental methods.

149
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,020
Then how about searching through Western methods?

150
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,160
Why would I consult you if I could do such a thing?

151
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,660
It's completely out of my field of expertise.

152
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,980
Got it.

153
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,030
I'll execute a Rihashijin over here.

154
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll tell you the results by phone.

155
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,360
I leave the rest to you.

156
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,270
Wait!

157
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,830
Are you all right to use any more magic?

158
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,890
So it's okay?

159
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,140
I'm a magician.

160
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm a specialist that's supposed to be using magic.

161
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,860
You want to know my whereabouts that much?

162
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,210
So how should I make my move now?

163
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,840
Huh?

164
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,020
Himegami-chan?

165
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,760
Is something bothering you?

166
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,560
It's not like that, but...

167
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,020
Somehow I feel{was having a feeling} that Kamijou-kun seemed a little strange today.

168
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,420
Well...

169
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,810
He might have been in a hurry because his next event was coming up soon.

170
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,900
But the atmosphere he had was somewhat strange.

171
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,720
He seemed really tense...

172
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,580
From that time...

173
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,520
But I don't think some event would make him feel that way{like that}.

174
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,960
So, in short, you're concerned {caring }about Kamijou-chan?

175
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,710
Huh?

176
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,220
You might want to word that differently.{it implies she likes Kamijou}

177
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,700
Since Kamijou-kun and I aren't that friendly to each other.

178
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,520
Also, he would be the one in trouble if some misunderstanding were to occur.

179
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,260
Himegami-chan, look at this.

180
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,250
Night Parade?

181
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,550
At night, the Academy City  will be lit up with illuminations and lasers.

182
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,910
It's going to be very beautiful.

183
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,550
How about inviting Kamijou-chan?

184
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,620
That's impossible.

185
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,480
Even if someone like me suddenly were to ask him out, he would be completely surprised.

186
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,600
Since it's not suited for me.

187
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,280
T-That's not true!

188
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,780
If you ask Kamijou-chan out for something you enjoy, he would surely be happy too.

189
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,260
He's that kind of boy.

190
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,110
I would never take him out.

191
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,150
Why are you so stubborn?

192
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:01,950
Anyway, I'm not going to take him out.

193
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,900
She noticed us.

194
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,990
Her movement suddenly changed.

195
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,830
She's heading northwest now.

196
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,000
Can't you use the Red-Shiki{Aka no Shiki}?

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,050
It's impossible.

198
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,340
To do so, I need to cut off the Rihashijin.

199
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,330
If I do that, I won't be able to trace Oriana's position.

200
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,770
Maintain the northwest heading.

201
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,020
She's trying to outrun the pursuit by going straight.

202
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,370
Hurry.

203
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,010
There's 1700m until she goes out of effective range.

204
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,700
You don't need to tell me!

205
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,640
Wait!

206
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,320
She suddenly changed direction!

207
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,550
What the hell?

208
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,520
She suddenly increased speed-

209
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,490
Tsuchimikado?!

210
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,470
She did it.

211
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,560
What is it? {filled}

212
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,330
Oriana doesn't know how far she has to go until she's out of the Rihashijin's range.

213
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,410
Then what would she do?

214
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:52,290
No way...

215
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,640
Yes, find the center of the spell and destroy Tsuchimikado .

216
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,400
We have to hurry!

217
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,280
To where?

218
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,410
Tsuchimikado's place, where else!?

219
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,960
I'm asking where that is!

220
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,060
We don't know where he is...

221
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,390
You need to stay focused{concentrated}.

222
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,830
If you can sense my whereabouts, then I can sense you too.

223
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,070
Since it seems that you're the brightest and most dangerous,

224
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,020
I came to destroy you.

225
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,640
Fallere825, remember that.

226
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,360
That's my magic name.

227
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,510
My name is Basis104.

228
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,290
Since I've announced my name, I will surely win.

229
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:12,780
I don't hate that kind of violent youth.

230
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,250
It must be your style to limit your magic usage as you possibly can.

231
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,250
If you don't, you'll die.

232
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,840
I've taken precautions such as putting a field over this place.

233
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,930
Help isn't going to come.

234
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,390
Those assholes who've become too accustomed to peace...

235
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,060
Wake up if you don't want to die!

236
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400
Too late.

237
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,720
You're all finished.

238
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,360
No way...

239
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
The field has been removed?

240
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,670
It seems as though it was a field that even I could break.

241
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,630
So you were okay with extreme actions despite your appearance?{violent sexual movement?}

242
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,060
Since I need to have what's happening here is known to the outside.

243
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,090
How stupid.

244
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,580
Even if the two that were chasing after me arrive,

245
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,580
I'm not talking about them.

246
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
What did you say?

247
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,780
Are you stupid?

248
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:33,310
How many Necessarius members do you think we have?

249
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,850
You thought I would believe such nonsense?

250
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,120
Tsukebumi Tamazusa.

251
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,580
It used to be a ceremonial item that makes people see illusions.

252
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,670
But if you alter the usage...

253
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,680
A communication spell?

254
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,200
Since we have discovered that the Stab Sword does not exist,

255
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,840
we have no reason to keep her on standby.

256
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,600
Right.

257
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,260
Kanzaki Kaori.

258
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,500
Didn't you think of the possibility that the Saint was in Japan?

259
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,560
And there's personal acquaintances of Kanzaki in the Academy City.

260
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,530
There won't be a big issue even in the rare case that all of this gets revealed.

261
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,270
Damn!

262
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,860
Futile resistance!

263
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,520
Well, I've destroyed the search spell for now.

264
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,330
Getting injured from dealing with an injured boy is stupid after all.

265
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,190
Damnit.

266
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:43,740
I would have actually wanted Kanzaki Kaori to appear though...

267
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,510
But...

268
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:49,930
She must be an idiot to actually believe in such nonsense like Tsukebumi Tamazusa.

269
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,450
So then...

270
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,860
I seem to be incapable of using Rihashijin again.

271
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,580
Tsuchimikado?

272
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:07,070
Oriana should be leaving this place now.

273
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,620
Since I've used a little bluff.

274
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,870
The subway is the closest way to leave from the underground passage Tsuchimikado is in now.

275
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,260
Looks like no one is chasing me.

276
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,410
Since the preparations for the Croce di Pietro are for later,

277
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,290
what should I do?

278
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:36,630
Thinking up of counter Saint spells seems interesting too.

279
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:39,990
Himegami-chan, we have to take a shortcut or we won't make the next-

280
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,740
Oh!

281
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,800
Komoe-sensei, how could you do that?

282
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,910
I-I'm sorry!

283
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,900
A-Are you okay over there?

284
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,620
Oh yes, I'm fine.

285
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,420
But shouldn't you be worried about yourselves?{I'd be worried about you.}

286
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,090
Himegami-chan is wet and transparent!

287
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,760
Komoe-sensei too, the part around your breast is pointed up as well.

288
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,980
A Celtic Cross?

289
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,260
From the Necessarius?

290
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,020
Himegami-chan?

291
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,490
What's wrong, Himegami-chan?

292
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,630
The transfer point closest from here...

293
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,510
It's an Autonomic Bus Stop 300 meters from here.

294
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,860
300 meters...

295
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,430
This scent is...

296
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,230
Komoe-sensei!

297
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,180
K-Kamijou-chan...!

298
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,270
Sensei, what's going on?

299
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,780
Sensei, what happened here?

300
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,120
We bumped into a woman.

301
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,680
She suddenly made a scary face...

302
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,610
All of a sudden...

303
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,100
So it's Oriana...

304
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,650
Why did she...?

305
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,600
There's isn't any reason for her to attack Himegami!

306
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,540
That.

307
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:16,140
That Ceremonial Item called the Walking Church is a special item.

308
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,290
She mistook her as an Index class magician, and thought she was a pursuer.

309
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,390
She was mistaken?

310
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,800
Doing all this to Himegami?

311
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,350
And it was all because of a mistake?

312
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,850
<i>Hereby, this place will be my hiding place</i>

313
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,390
You should call the ambulance.

314
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,610
You should also wait at the entrance of the alley.

315
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,380
They won't find you here.

316
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,180
Wait!

317
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,140
What's wrong?

318
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,910
She was involved in this because of us!

319
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,910
How could we leave her like this!

320
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:55,960
Then what could you do?

321
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,090
Quit acting up, newb!

322
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:04,060
There's nothing we can do for this injured girl.

323
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,940
What we can do now though, is chase after Oriana.

324
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,560
If you have any intention to defend someone, clench your fist.{make a grip.}{to punch}

325
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,760
Your right hand only has the power to destroy illusions.

326
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:21,940
Where is the power to defend illusions?

327
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,450
Damnit!

328
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,270
Don't think that anger is all for your own.

329
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,530
What are you doing?

330
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,850
It all worked out when it was Sister-chan's case.

331
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:42,360
No way, it was you...?

332
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,570
Why won't Himegami-chan be healed?

333
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:58,390
We were talking about the Night Parade and stuff until just now.

334
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:59,350
But...

335
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,960
No, it's not like that.

336
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,240
Like scooping sea water with a bucket.

337
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,500
First, you set the area you will partition off into the miniature garden.

338
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Kamijou Touma, you chase after Oriana.

339
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,500
Wait...

340
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,110
You're not going to...

341
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,960
Don't expect too much from me.

342
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,140
This is not my specialty either.

343
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:22,700
I will borrow the knowledge of the Index Prohibitum inside her, and only do First Aid.

344
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,070
If you want to solve everything,

345
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,580
walk past this point.

346
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,840
Kamijou Touma.

347
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,060
I got it.

348
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,640
Stiyl, I leave Himegami in your hands.

349
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:36,420
I'm sorry, Himegami.

350
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,460
I'll be back to your hospital room before the Night Parade starts.

351
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,140
So please wait for me, surely.

352
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:24,940
The secret to the Croce di Pietro is now known.
