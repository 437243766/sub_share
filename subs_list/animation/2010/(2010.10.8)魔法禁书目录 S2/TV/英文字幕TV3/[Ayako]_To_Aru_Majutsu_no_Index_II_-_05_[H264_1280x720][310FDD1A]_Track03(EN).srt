1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,150
I thought I came by myself{alone} to save Orsola, who was held captive by the Roman Catholics.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:06,940
I thought...

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,820
But Stiyl?

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,780
Tatemiya...

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,490
And even Index?

6
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:18,460
I guess no one wanted this incident to have an ending as boring as this.

7
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:50,620
<b>Lotus Wand</b>

8
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,350
Focus more on attack and less on defense.
<b>Lotus Wand</b>

9
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,610
<b>Lotus Wand</b>

10
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,380
Destroy the enemy of our Lord, exterminate with no regard to our lives!
<b>Lotus Wand</b>

11
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,100
Destroy the enemy of our Lord, exterminate with no regard to our lives!

12
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,490
N-No way...

13
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,610
To evade the Sheol Fear, they...

14
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,700
Damn it!

15
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,420
Damn it.

16
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,710
There's no end to this.

17
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,600
Over here!

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,850
Touma!

19
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,020
Hurry up!

20
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,930
At least we seem to be safe, but...

21
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,670
Orsola, Can you walk?

22
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,990
You seem to be worrying about everything.

23
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,620
I wasn't injured too badly.

24
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,110
What should we do?

25
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:14,040
I doubt my Sheol Fear will be effective if they can't hear anything. {damage their ears like that.}

26
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,420
Spell Intercept can only be used against one opponent at a time.

27
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,550
My men seem to be fighting hard, but...

28
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:26,770
Humans are frightening when they attack without any regard for their own lives.

29
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,190
If...

30
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,620
We may be able to achieve a breakthrough if we had the "Liber AL vel Legis" here, but...

31
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,110
True...

32
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,610
Using the Spell Style of the Angels written in the "Liber AL vel Legis",

33
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,570
you can simply announce your intent to release its seal and it would be useful in negotiating against them.

34
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,950
But they staged the stealing of the "Liber AL vel Legis" in order to deceive us...

35
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,910
In other words, it's highly unlikely that the original copy is in Japan.

36
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,420
It is here!

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,260
If I remember correctly, even Index was unable to decipher the "Liber AL vel Legis", right?

38
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,340
In other words, you must've glanced through it at least once to attempt to decipher it,

39
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,890
this means it'd be strange for the original copy to not be stored in your brain.

40
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,430
Right.

41
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,770
It's left in its encrypted text...

42
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,230
No good!

43
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,240
If you do that, she will memorize the deciphered contents of the "Liber AL vel Legis".

44
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,710
If that happens, you'll be targeted by even more magicians than you are currently. {right now}

45
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,450
Are you worried about me?

46
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,210
Kamijou Touma!

47
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,370
What?

48
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,130
You should familiarize yourself with the background information.

49
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,590
If this thing becomes more complicated, and she becomes ill,

50
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:43,430
I will burn your soul to its very last shred.

51
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,350
Damn it.

52
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:54,060
Hey, so how do you decipher the "Liber AL vel Legis"?

53
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,140
Oh, yes.

54
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,520
I'll tell you now.

55
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,060
It's not like we'll actually use the power of the "Liber AL vel Legis".

56
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,290
We only need to show that we can use it at whim.

57
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,490
It's basically Temurah, or letter replacement method. {better phrasing}

58
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,910
As an exception to the normal rule, the line number becomes very important.

59
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,460
First, you place all 22 Hebrew characters into two lines.

60
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,180
Next, you focus on the line number.

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,180
That's enough.

62
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,720
I understand it for the most part.

63
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,640
Umm... What are you saying you've understood?

64
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:36,140
That's not the correct method to decipher the text.

65
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,600
This is a fake method the author left behind to trick you.{This is a dummy answer provided as a trap.}

66
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,360
The "Liber AL vel Legis" is scary because there are over a hundred ways to decipher it.

67
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,980
A different output is obtained with every cipher method,

68
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,780
and every single one of them is a dummy result.

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,700
It's not that "Liber AL vel Legis" is unreadable. {at its readable by noone}

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,540
It's a magic book that can be read by anyone, but they are all misled by a wrong cipher method.

71
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
That...

72
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,250
In a way, you can consider yourself saved.

73
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,380
Hey, do you think they'll forgive us, {ffd: next line begins at tsutara}

74
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,710
if we tell them now that we didn't know the cipher method after all?

75
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,350
That'll be impossible.

76
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:18,150
Since we've seen too much {deep}of their dark side for them to back off.

77
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,910
There must be a backdoor somewhere!

78
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,640
Whatever you're trying to pull, {ffd: line splits at jiyuu because the next part has longer time to read}

79
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,890
I don't think that you can move around so freely going up against so many opponents.{However you think, I can't consider you can move around freely while going against all that many.}

80
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,850
We have a little plan after all.

81
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,020
A plan you say?

82
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,860
Oh, I see.

83
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,850
So that's what it was.

84
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,320
Rubbish.

85
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,070
After making such a cool entrance, you set your friends up as decoys just to come here?

86
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,620
Orsola Aquinas said something like this:

87
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,580
"They take action through believing, not deceiving."

88
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,840
What a joke, don't you think?

89
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,300
After all, you're alive and breathing because you used someone as bait to deceive others.{Since in the end you are decieving someone and breathing by using someone as a bait.}

90
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,550
No, I believe in them.

91
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,940
I would be happy if they believed in me too,

92
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,100
that I can solve my own issues.

93
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:50,340
If you stop me, the commander, do you think that my subordinates will stop attacking?

94
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,020
Fine.

95
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,120
I have too much free time.

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,160
How about I occupy myself by crushing your deluded hope instead?

97
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,280
As above, so below, the fifth of the five elements,

98
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,250
open the crosier that symbolizes peace and order, {line is split at Kami or too long etc}

99
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,340
the first icon under the law of God's Child and the Cross, link foreign objects and people!

100
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,010
A coordinate attack? {the attack uses coordinates, so saying coordinated makes it feel like more than 1 person is attacking}

101
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,450
Teleport?

102
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,240
That staff...

103
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,650
Of course you'd notice.

104
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,370
If I scar this,

105
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,090
it's connected with other things like this-

106
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:48,960
Damn...

107
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,560
Where is that attack coming from?

108
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,810
Oh, no!

109
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,200
Don't think that you can dodge them so easily.

110
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,180
If I set the attacks in the right space by predicting{forseeing} what you will do,

111
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,870
you would just jump right into them by yourself.

112
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,130
It's unforgivable, eh?

113
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,980
Christianity has spread with the purpose of bringing salvation to all.

114
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:44,530
Taking advantage of that and abusing the power like this...

115
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:54,020
You're abusing your power indiscreetly as well.

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,590
Oh, you're mad at being hit?{O U MAD BRO? YES  LAWLUMAD no fu}{U MAD 4 BEIN' HIT}

117
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:03,940
The crosier was evolved from a war hammer that was used to break through the enemy's armor.

118
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:08,300
What's wrong with using an object meant to hit something?

119
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:18,500
Modern western magic is naturally like a secret trick used within Christianity. {edit check with Hells, no}

120
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,610
It's rather strange that people other than us are using it. {edit check with Hells}

121
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,400
In the end, all teachings other than Roman Catholicism aren't teachings at all. {edit check with Hells, no}

122
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,940
If you bought this you were ripped off.

123
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,570
You're rather annoying.

124
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:40,580
Just die already, I'm getting tired. {Die in this tedious factory-like work already please.} {What is this? lol?}

125
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,210
I was waiting for that attack to come!

126
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,040
No way...

127
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:27,240
Am I going back again...?

128
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,550
To that place?

129
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,490
No!

130
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,010
No way would I go back!

131
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,250
Never shall I go back!

132
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:57,140
I'm sorry to interrupt your concentration. {when you are trying so hard}

133
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,730
It looks like they have ended.

134
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,520
It's quiet outside.

135
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,700
It seems like you were trying to solve the issue by defeating{beating} me while using them{they were to work} as decoys.

136
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,010
It seems like the illusion ended simply.

137
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,930
Yes it's as you said.

138
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,920
Your illusion has ended,

139
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,770
Agnese Sanctis.

140
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,980
There have been 4300 cards placed around this church.

141
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,730
It's not that many in numbers,{the numbers are no much of a deal}

142
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,230
well, we can't underestimate the power of the Amakusa,

143
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,660
so using the position of the Runic cards to draw an even larger picture,

144
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,700
this church was made into a huge magic circle...

145
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,160
A multi-composition magic circle that uses everything around,

146
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:03,040
this kind of little trick stuff is impossible for me.

147
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,100
I told you that we had a plan.

148
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,300
They weren't running around as decoys.

149
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,180
They were just placing the cards around the building for this.

150
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:20,690
We are still greater in number.

151
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,230
If we all collectively come to attack them, they are nothing.

152
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,280
What are you doing?

153
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,290
Hurry and...!

154
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,580
T-They are shaken...

155
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,790
Even when we can use sheer numbers to win...

156
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,830
They act through believing.

157
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,920
How interesting.

158
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,380
What do I do?

159
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,560
How can I?

160
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,180
The method?

161
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,510
The timing?

162
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,820
The weapons?

163
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,100
How can I choose what?

164
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,850
It's the end, Agnese.

165
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,430
You should already know yourself.

166
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,190
Your confidence had been killed ages ago.

167
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,420
Touma!

168
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,710
Touma, wake up!

169
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,890
Touma!

170
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,180
O-Oh, you woke up?

171
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,020
Oh, it's Kanzaki.

172
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,810
I was intending to leave.

173
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,150
Oh, a letter left for me?

174
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,530
I-It's nothing.

175
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,570
Since we have the chance to speak directly.

176
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,260
No letter is needed, right?

177
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,510
Huh?

178
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,790
I am here for a follow-up, or like explain what happened to Orsola Aquinas.

179
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,590
Was I needlessly meddling?

180
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,840
I will listen. I definitely want to know. {check please}

181
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:05,970
Things were being solved by absorbing Orsola Aquinas and the Amakusa into the Anglican Church.

182
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:11,650
This seems to be the most effective{have most purpose} in preventing revenge or assassination by the Roman Catholics.

183
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,150
So that means, Orsola Aquinas's position as being dangerous won't change from now on either?

184
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,120
No.

185
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,720
The Anglican Church has publicized the fake deciphering method Orsola Aquinas had.

186
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,920
When this becomes known as a mistranslation,

187
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,670
I assume she will not be chased with intentions regarding the "Liber AL vel Legis".

188
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,370
Huh?

189
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,080
But the Amakusa will be settling under the Anglican Church too, right?

190
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,240
Yes, it seems they wanted things to turn out like this.

191
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,550
I should have told them strongly not to go after my steps though...

192
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,430
I see.

193
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,600
You are part of the Anglican Church after all.

194
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,820
Geez...

195
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,110
Oh...

196
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:00,530
Erm, I'm sorry for the trouble this time.

197
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,740
Huh what do you mean?

198
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
Well this time, umm...

199
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,290
Because of my own personal reasons...

200
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,580
I must say I caused you so many troubles...

201
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,290
Kamiyan~

202
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,670
I came to play.

203
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,090
The "get well soon" gift is a gorgeous pudding with a melon on top.

204
00:17:18,090 --> 00:17:19,710
Oh Neechin?

205
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,980
It looks like the time has come to give a full-hearted apology to Kamiyan?

206
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,390
So she is going to go on with this typical,

207
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:29,190
"I will return the favor for all the troubles I have caused you until now"

208
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,330
and tell you something like "Ask me anything".

209
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,950
Hey it's the Crane's Repayment of kindness through erotic services!{fail joke at tsuru no ongaeshi}

210
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:39,730
It's not like that!

211
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,740
But, you are going to undress after all.

212
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,910
I won't!

213
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,240
What do you mean by after all?

214
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,420
Hey, so you're going to wear any outfit as repayment?

215
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,340
What great service!

216
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,640
Just keep silent and disappear.

217
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,550
Yeah right.

218
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,840
I guess I shouldn't get in the way of your fun.

219
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,220
We're not doing anything!

220
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,600
Uh um...

221
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,010
Huh?

222
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:14,570
Tell me it's just a joke Tsuchimikado made about that repaying stuff.

223
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,280
But, what else can I do?

224
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:23,940
I keep having you carry such an impossible load every time.

225
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,800
And this time you even solved our issues.

226
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,540
It's far past the degree that can be forgiven just by a simple apology.

227
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,870
Well...

228
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,790
I guess you don't have to worry about it.

229
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,050
Since that problem of ours has been solved successfully after all.

230
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,470
Ours, you said?

231
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,590
Oh?

232
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,760
About me and the Amakusa.

233
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,510
Oh yeah, the Anglican Church is included too.

234
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,450
And Orsola, Index, Stiyl, and also you too.

235
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,780
Those are what made up "us", this time.{what? Nozomori}

236
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,730
It seems there's big trouble in England and Rome,

237
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,940
but being a foreigner in all that, I can't really see the difference.

238
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,450
I'm not siding with Index because she is a member of the Anglican Church.

239
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,140
I am siding with Anglican Church for now because Index is a member of them.

240
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:21,940
I would probably go help Agnese, if she asked me for help.

241
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,380
This time she happened to be the bad guy.

242
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,360
But there isn't a rule that forces her to always be on the bad side.

243
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:42,660
The Roman Catholics are trying to conclude this incident as Agnese Sanctis and a military faction gone amok.

244
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,820
They are trying to explain that it was not the intent of the whole Roman Catholic Church to assassinate Orsola.

245
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,090
Usually, if they fail to control their subordinates, then they can't be relieved of their responsibility...

246
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,760
Come to think of it, you seemed to have known from the beginning what the true intentions of the Roman Catholics were.

247
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,350
Then why didn't you tell me from the beginning to save Orsola.

248
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,270
Making things this complicated...

249
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,630
But that wasn't everything.

250
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,180
I didn't think Orsola's cipher method was wrong.

251
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,470
But I didn't mind it being either way.

252
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,180
This is just a what if situation, but Stiyl...

253
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,150
If we had failed to save Orsola,

254
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,570
would the situation have changed in any way?

255
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,660
If she were to have been sent back to the Roman Catholics,

256
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,960
only execution would await her.

257
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,080
The "Liber AL vel Legis" wouldn't have been deciphered regardless of what had happened.

258
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,710
Then why did you give me orders to bring her a cross? {yourself give orders to present her a personal cross}

259
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,090
Didn't you intend to save her from the beginning?

260
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,100
I-It's not like that!

261
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,840
I intervened in this only for the benefit of the Anglican Church.

262
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,110
By benefit you mean...?

263
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,570
Kanzaki Kaori.

264
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,700
Because she has great power, and a good feel of justice,

265
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,030
she has the tendency to take action on her own will.

266
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,280
This time her stand point was very close to becoming critical.{This time too, she was actually reaching up to a very dangerous spot.}

267
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,030
You heard reports about what happened to those stupid knights.

268
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,720
Yes.

269
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,370
We would need a stronger shackle on her from now on.

270
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,710
Not a shackle in a negative way that threatens to harm her friends if she disobeys,{telling her that we will inflict harm on her if she disobeys}{not a shackle in a negative way that threatens harm on her friends if she disobeys}{if she strolls from god's path her action will be reacted up with consiquences?} {she isnt using religious terms here}

271
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:34,030
but one that reminds her while she obeys our orders,{does listen to our orders} we shall defend the Amakusa from the Roman Catholics.{TLC please ^^ last one :) }

272
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,550
See?

273
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,910
There's no better benefit for us, is there?

274
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,540
That bitch.{female fox - evil hag}
