<b>Before Outbreak of Combat</b>

2
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,530
Kazakiri!

3
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,540
Kazakiri!

4
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,140
Hey, Kazakiri!

5
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,380
Regained consciousness?{}

6
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,620
Good, you were all right.

7
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,180
This is wrong...

8
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:07,220
Why did it turn into something like this?

9
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,390
It's all my fault, yet...

10
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,690
Why am I the only one left without a scratch?{R: because people die when they are killed.}{Why am I the only one left who is unharmed?}

11
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:15,380
If I can't be together with everyone,

12
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,880
then why was I born?

13
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,330
I am a monster who can only exist due to the power of those with abilities...

14
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
Her calling me a friend...

15
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,110
I thought I even became a little bit like a human...{I thought I even became a little bit more humanic...}

16
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,670
I don't want this anymore!

17
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,910
Hit me and end this once and for all!

18
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,950
Why?

19
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,580
Why are you making such a face?

20
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,650
Because I'm relieved.

21
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,230
Why I have such an ability in my right hand, I do not know.{Why does my right hand poccess this ability, even I dont know,}

22
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,540
But...{but...}

23
00:02:54,090 --> 00:03:00,740
If it's going to erase my friend, a right hand like this is better severed off. {If that's going to erase a friend of mine, it might better be off being cutt off.}

24
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,420
Why...

25
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,990
You protected everyone.

26
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,370
You worked hard to protect everyone.{You worked hard to protect 'em all.}

27
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,230
Is that any different from the humans you picture in your mind? {Is that any different from the humans you think of?}

28
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,610
Be proud.

29
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,570
Look straight ahead.

30
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,840
Since you have fought for those you don't even know the faces of,{For you, who fought for those you don't even know,}

31
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,030
and persisted on protecting everyone.{and persisted on protecting everyone.}

32
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,640
There's no reason you should be looked down upon.{R: add "on yourself" at the end?}{There's no reason you should been looked down up.}

33
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,860
I'll check to see if anyone needs treatment, just in case.

34
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,550
After that's finished, let's go home.

35
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,660
Since we don't know when you might disappear.

36
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,990
We have to meet up with Index before that happens.

37
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,410
Don't say why or anything.

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,160
It's, of course, because we are friends.

39
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,330
A-Are you all right?

40
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,960
The thing on your back resembled a Telesma...{That thing on your back ressembled a Telesma...}

41
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,070
What in the world...

42
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,840
Hey!

43
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,840
What in the world happened?{it's just 'What in the world happened'}

44
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,540
Seems like that huge wing has disappeared as well.

45
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,920
If there's something I can help with, I'll head your way.

46
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,830
I'll go call a doctor now!

47
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,700
Hey!

48
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,130
Accelerator, there's something I want to talk to you about.

49
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,680
Are you okay now?

50
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,360
Huh?

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,060
Telepathy?

52
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,860
Although it's minimal, some of my calculation abilities are back.

53
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,630
Correct.

54
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,290
I've prepared multiple, Telepathy-type ability users in here. {I've prepared a number of telepathy-type ability users in here.}

55
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,020
What are you here for?{What do you want?}

56
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,640
I should have a talk with you about the round of incidents that you triggered,

57
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,490
and the damage Academy City has sustained.

58
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,170
You're going to cut me to shreds and use me as a research subject?{R: I'd do that minus the shredding part.}

59
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,170
That's one path...{That's one way to go...}

60
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,940
But don't you have any intention of acting together with us? {but wouldn't you prefer to cooperate with us?}

61
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,150
Is Academy City going to start a war or something?

62
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,660
That, I cannot answer. {That's the one thing I can't answer.}

63
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,150
I see.

64
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,620
There's only one thing I should say.

65
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,900
Quit joking.

66
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,150
Academy City is on the brink of a crisis now.

67
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,840
We want to resist this, and we want you to help as well.{We want to get through this, and we need your help for that.}

68
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,120
If Academy City is to be completely erased here,

69
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,960
then will we, ability users, have a place to live in? {then where will we, the ability users, have a place to live?}

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,700
And the same applies to other technology.

71
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,430
Tell me one thing.

72
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,670
What is it?

73
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,980
The mastermind behind all of this.{The guy behind all of this...}

74
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,400
I will rip off the neck of the person who treated this kid like this! {I'll rip off his neck for treating that kid like this!}

75
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,590
No problem, but... {No problemó, but...}

76
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,600
He's probably just going to be a scapegoat.{It's prolly just going to be a scapegoat.}

77
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,270
I see.

78
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,890
And, what are you going to do?

79
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,680
Do as you wish.

80
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,350
That's a good answer.

81
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,990
Nice to meet you, newcomer. {Nice to meet you, rookie.}

82
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,360
Is that Terra?

83
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,750
Yes it is.

84
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,110
It's Terra of the Left.

85
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,840
Have you finished over there? {Did you finish over there?}

86
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,720
Vent was taken down. {Vento was taken down.}

87
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:58,880
I have retrieved her and withdrew the independently acting troops who were in the outer parts of Academy City. {I retrieved her and withdrew the independent acting troops into the outer parts of Academy City.}{who were in the outer parts of Academy City}

88
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,460
Good work.

89
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,060
What do we do next?

90
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,540
If you may, I can go rip off the target's neck myself.{If you wish, I can go rip off that target's neck all by myself.}

91
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,340
Let's not do that. {Let's not do that.}

92
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:15,600
After carefully hearing what you have to say, we should revise how to make this Academy City fall. {After hearing what you have to say we prolly should revise on how to make this Academy City fall.}{We will hear what you have to say carefully and then}

93
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,310
Making Academy City fall... huh?

94
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,480
Don't you like it?

95
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,930
I'm bad with little tricks.

96
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,500
When beating enemies, it's always easier to face them up front.

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Don't you think there are countless ways for it to be used?

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,500
For example, that fallen angel...

99
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,060
I will not agree to looting in war zones.

100
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,550
Oh, my dear knight has different opinions than me.

101
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not a knight.

102
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,220
I'm just a fail, mercenary gangster.

103
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,330
{Whatever, just come back quickly while taking Vent along.}Whatever, just return quickly with Vent.

104
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,930
That's also an order from the Fiamma of the Right. {That's also an order from Fiamma of the Right.}

105
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,010
Understood.

106
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,900
{Is Academy City such a weak existence as you think it is?}Do you really think Academy City is such a weak entity?

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,880
Terra of the Left.

108
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,570
Good morning, Aleister.

109
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,110
There's something I should tell you.

110
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,030
What is it?

111
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,090
I'd like you to stop playing with my emotions.

112
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,660
What if I don't listen to you?

113
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,890
They are my patients.

114
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,150
And I'm a doctor.

115
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,630
You should understand.

116
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,240
Since your life was saved by me in the past.

117
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,300
Do you regret it?

118
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,340
Are you seriously asking me that?

119
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,820
I cannot stop.

120
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,040
It has gone beyond that level.

121
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,350
Then, farewell.

122
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,800
My gentle, gentle enemy...

123
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,690
Finished!

124
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,900
Hurry to the school shop!

125
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,160
Get the Yakisoba buns!{Breads?}{it's yakisoba filled in hot dog buns}

126
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,740
Hey!

127
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,060
Don't run in the hallways!

128
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,430
It's rare today...

129
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,770
Someone with a delicious looking thing came as usual.{R: WTF?}

130
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,870
I have nothing to share for free.

131
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,840
If you want some, it would be a trade.

132
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:14,050
You sure got some great spirit to prepare lunch everyday.

133
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,440
Oh...

134
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,340
The watery content has seeped into the rice.

135
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,280
T-The extracts seeping into the rice, in a way, can actually become delicious!

136
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,200
Are you saying that because you're jealous?

137
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,530
No!

138
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,740
If you're going to make such a face, try eating this Satoimo.

139
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,240
It might not be bad- {This might be bad-}

140
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,850
A-Are you all right, Himegami?

141
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,400
What? Should I rub your back?

142
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,040
How are you doing, Himegami?

143
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,510
I see. With more force?

144
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,490
What the heck are you doing...

145
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,930
Fukiyose...

146
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:20,940
Why are you always eating such plain looking bread?

147
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,800
What's with you?

148
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,260
It's actually really delicious!

149
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,540
Ability Increasing Bread, containing 12 ingredients that stimulate your brain...

150
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,840
Want to try my Satoimo?

151
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,860
I'll remind you, today I'm wearing a front-hook type.{bra}

152
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,850
Huh?

153
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,760
Seriously?

154
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,550
They say the field trip might get canceled if the authorities increase the city's entry restrictions.

155
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:49,610
I hope it doesn't affect the Ichihanaransai.

156
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,170
Oh yeah, the Anti-skill teachers will be thinking of counter-measures, so they might not be able to attend the midterm examinations.

157
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,220
Really?

158
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,010
A war, huh?

159
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,760
That's really troublesome.

160
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,540
Because if a war starts, the prices of meat and vegetables would increase.

161
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,260
And also, same goes for oil as we all know.{FFFFFFFFFF earthquake does this too}

162
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,990
Hey, Kamijou!

163
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,860
Why are you keeping silent?

164
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,650
Oh, nothing.

165
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,960
I just wondered if we should have things like nabe now before that happens.{nabe = hot pot with many ingredients stewed in together.}

166
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,700
So that we don't regret it later by not having some while we could.

167
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,610
Oh, that's true though...

168
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,160
Oh?

169
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,010
You're having nabe tonight?

170
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,730
If you want Sukiyaki, I know a good place that is cheap and delicious.

171
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,930
What? You guys are going out somewhere?

172
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,190
You shouldn't keep a good place to yourself!

173
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,630
Rather, why suddenly nabe?

174
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,220
Nabe?!

175
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,970
We should have a vote!

176
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,830
Huh?

177
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,070
Why did this turn into a discussion on where to go eat dinner after class?

178
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,240
Fukiyose-san?

179
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,250
Geez...

180
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,270
Fukiyose forehead deluxe!?

181
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,540
Nabe for tonight

182
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,890
I will take care of you all, so cast your votes!
Nabe for tonight

183
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,490
Tsukuyomi-sensei, I heard you are protecting a new runaway girl.

184
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,800
I was feeling a little lonely after Himegami-chan went to a school dormitory.{R: "a" or "the" ?}

185
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,170
Now, I'm starting to feel better after Musujime-chan's arrival.{After Musujime-chan arrived, I'm  starting to be fine again.}

186
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,830
All of those who stayed at my place left coldly after a short while.

187
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,950
It's decided!

188
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,170
It has been decided that we will all go to Sukiyaki tonight!

189
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,090
I'll settle this down now!

190
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,670
Hey!

191
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,950
What are you making a mess about?

192
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,310
Oh, Komoe-sensei!

193
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:43,590
Good for them, they are doing stupid things...

194
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,930
So then...

195
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,940
Itadakimasu!{Vagina bones}

196
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm getting more and more requests from parents asking us to send their children back home because it'll be dangerous once a war starts.

197
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,240
Oh, things have gone that far?

198
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,230
Kamijou!

199
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,780
Why are you mixing the eggs so slowly?

200
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,410
Geez, so annoying!

201
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,650
Give it to me for a second!

202
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,190
You're the bossy type, huh?{R: consider adding ", huh?" at the end.}

203
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:32,680
Kami-yan, from what I see on the menu, it seems that the prices have not changed yet.

204
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,380
Y-Yeah...

205
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:34,930
Here.

206
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,160
Thank you.

207
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,650
But the prices may have increased already in the supply departments.{But in the supply departments the pricses rose already...}

208
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,830
That means, we should eat as much as we can now.

209
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,690
Hey, you're only eating the meat!

210
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:50,040
Touma, seconds for meat!

211
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:50,940
Meat, meat!

212
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:51,990
I haven't even had a piece yet...{I didn't even had a piece yet...}
Meat, meat!

213
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,490
Meat, meat!
I haven't even had a piece yet...{I didn't even had a piece yet...}

214
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,060
A war, eh?

215
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,810
I have to do something...

216
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,820
Kami-yan.

217
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:15,960
If you think the war that's about to happen is your fault,

218
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
then you're truly mistaken.

219
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,520
You have protected the people around you up until now.{You protected the people around you up until now.}

220
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,770
Is that so...?

221
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,450
The war happened because the people in the back messed up.

222
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:31,840
It will begin.

223
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,300
Yeah.

224
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,860
The magnitude of fighting will change.

225
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,280
We won't be able to continue on like we are now.

226
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,410
That's right.

227
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,480
You could say it was a miracle that we were able to manage like this up until now.

228
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,390
I was too lenient on myself until now.

229
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,040
The world I don't know about, I left it all to others.

230
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,500
But from now on, I can't leave it like that.

231
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:05,580
I have to step into the world I haven't seen yet.

232
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,540
Tsuchimikado, I've decided...

233
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,070
Kami-yan...

234
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,500
Yes, I will...

235
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,300
I will study English!{R: fuck you bitch! you really got me excited back there XD}

236
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,290
What?!

237
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,400
I'm now challenging Level 3 of Daily English Conversation.

238
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,210
English is difficult after all.

239
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,810
Why study English in this situation?

240
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,200
Until now, everyone has been using Japanese for me.

241
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,170
But it's wrong for me to be dependent on that.

242
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,480
That means, the conclusion is...

243
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,580
W-Why...?

244
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,730
Practice number 42:

245
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,310
Beginning.

246
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,090
Practice number 43:

247
00:14:59,090 --> 00:14:59,740
Beginning.

248
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,910
What are you here for, disguised bastard?

249
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,550
I tried to hide my existence as much as I can.

250
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:14,890
I guess I'm far from perfect.

251
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:18,740
Unabara Mitsuki, huh?{Unabara Mitsuki, it is?}

252
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,650
Though my face and name are fake.

253
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:24,890
Have you decided on your weapon?

254
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,300
There aren't any that seem to make me feel comfortable.

255
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:30,490
Maybe I won't find any after I see the whole collection of guns around the world.

256
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,300
How about you make a list of equipment that you would use in the condition that you would use your ability?{R: how about "under the condition"? No raw so no idea what is being meant.}

257
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,950
Don't talk like you're so smart.

258
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,080
This is unreliable.

259
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:46,670
From the reports of the technology department at GROUP, I hear your ability usage time has been extended to 30 minutes.

260
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,050
GROUP, eh?

261
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,560
Is there anything you're unsatisfied with for the electrode tuning?

262
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,060
Whether it will be 30 minutes or 3 days, it's the end if something irregular happens.

263
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,990
"I can't fight because it broke down."

264
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,090
You can't survive with an excuse like that.

265
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,520
Is that the only thing you needed to tell me?

266
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,980
We have a job order from the Administrative Board of Directors.

267
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:16,610
Academy City is forming positions for the counter Roman Catholic battle.

268
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:21,250
But to do so, it's true that the defense inside is becoming weaker.

269
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:25,700
This time, we will sweep away a group that would use that chance to come in.

270
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,920
I thought I was going to substitute for that freaking Kihara dude.

271
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,520
But I never thought I would be given such a stupid task.

272
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,340
You can't be annoyed at me.

273
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,600
It was you who fell into this spot.

274
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,230
I'll tell you one thing, so understand bastard.

275
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,920
Human lives are frail.

276
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,780
So frail that they will break down with one touch of my finger.

277
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,350
That's why you should be a little considerate.

278
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,120
Or else, I might crush something unnecessary.

279
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,740
I'll watch it.

280
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,620
Can I continue?

281
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,500
As you wish.

282
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:07,070
The target we have is Skill-Out.

283
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,500
You might be more knowledgeable about it.

284
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,640
Yeah.

285
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,250
A bunch of armed level 0 bastards.

286
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,020
Yeah.

287
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:19,550
It seems they are building toys now.

288
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,510
Toys?

289
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,680
A rocket launcher made by carving wood and placing explosives{in them?}.

290
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,290
It's something like a Bouhiya that was made in the Edo period.

291
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,140
They've been doing work all over the place these past few weeks.

292
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,930
Like placing abandoned bicycles in front of emergency escape routes,

293
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,150
or putting rubbish into waste drains around VIP facilities...

294
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,080
While they are nothing that should be considered security issues...

295
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,420
Does GROUP have to clean up some stupid children's pranks?

296
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,420
However, that's over 20,000 cases.

297
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:01,840
At emergency situations like orange or red, they would be detected as errors.

298
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,190
Are those Bouhiya for that?

299
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:08,330
If the server goes down from the huge number of error reports,

300
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,510
Anti-Skill won't come even if Skill-Out went on a rampage.

301
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,290
Then you can just cancel the alarm.

302
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,770
That's if we are not at war at the moment.

303
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,490
Inside or outside, enemies all around, heh...

304
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:25,450
Academy City must be hated by so many people.

305
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,740
It's our job to do something about them.

306
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,050
The target's name is Komaba Ritoku.

307
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:37,160
He's the leader controlling Skill-Out now.

308
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,670
He's also the brain for them.

309
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:45,310
We will quickly dispose of him to prevent the plans of Skill-Out.

310
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:54,320
Why are we using a trash collection car?

311
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,650
It's quite useful.

312
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,410
Since we need to dispose of corpses too.

313
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,320
A collection car that goes for corpses of bastards...

314
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,700
This isn't a joking matter...

315
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,390
As in the order, we will come to collect in 20 minutes.

316
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,520
Take care.

317
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,590
I'll have to ride that whether I win or lose...

318
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,340
Regardless of me being alive or dead.

319
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,140
Counter-security robot measures, eh?

320
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,090
Tricks to prevent surveillance satellites from catching activities...

321
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,120
A nostalgic air...

322
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,050
Is Tsuchimikado there?

323
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,400
I thought you might be having your first battle.

324
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,650
I have something to warn you about.

325
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,880
A warning, huh?

326
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,370
So what are the contents, Sempai?{So what the shit do you want, Sempai?}

327
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,770
Do not believe in us.

328
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,630
Huh?

329
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:02,180
We are all a group of people who will be problems if we ever become public.

330
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,160
There is no goal in a group of selected people with such problems.

331
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:11,390
You're saying that I was expecting some reward or something?

332
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,320
By just following orders from the Administrative Board of Directors, you can't outsmart them.

333
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,930
That's what I'm saying.

334
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,680
To still win, what should you do?

335
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,590
You should recognize that.

336
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:28,040
You and I, both have people to defend.

337
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,010
Is that your only topic?

338
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,570
End it quickly and come back.

339
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,530
Musujime would start her job over there soon.

340
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,630
Job?

341
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,530
I never heard it would be a competition.

342
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,310
What she's after isn't a person.

343
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,810
It's money.

344
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:53,220
Rather, she was still usable?

345
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:55,480
She's the same as you.

346
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,590
She's reinforced.

347
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,980
I see.

348
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,280
That's fine.

349
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,890
So then...

350
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,960
Let's begin it all.

351
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,630
It's clean up time.

352
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,850
I'll finish it in 10 minutes.

353
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,600
Now 9 locations already...

354
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,860
This is too easy.

355
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,790
I would like you to show us some mercy.

356
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,230
Ability user...

357
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,870
Komaba Ritoku.

358
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:51,520
Oh my, I met the target first.

359

Things become chaotic, with Misaka Misuzu getting involved.

362
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,660
Me and Accelerator will again...

363
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,230
Next episode: Skill Out.

364
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:39,240
