1
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,030
Archbishop!

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,320
W-What?!

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,040
Is the entry on this report real?

4
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,330
Do you understand that you could change the world with a single statement?

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,630
Who do you think you are?!

6
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,890
You dared walking into a lady's bathroom, Stiyl!

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,880
That's outrageous for a clergyman-!

8
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,680
Just answer me...

9
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,530
Tell me about the details, please.

10
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,400
Now!

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
My attire is clinging to me...

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,460
My sexy figure is getting exposed...

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,910
We mustn't!

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,830
Look away, Stiyl!

15
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,000
My body cannot be seen by any mortal!

16
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,260
<b>Serial Number

17
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,430
Why did the Archbishop send us something so complicated and arduous?
<b>Serial Number

18
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,890
Why did the Archbishop send us something so complicated and arduous?

19
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,370
Jesus...

20
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,400
A river is more than enough for cleaning and such...

21
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,140
I wouldn't say that much...

22
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,190
It appears that you simply press this button.

23
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:07,540
Why don't we ignore this and hand-wash the clothes?

24
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,750
Don't give up so soon!

25
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,790
We're just a hair away from never having to wash clothes again!

26
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:16,920
Didn't we finish today's worth of laundry this evening?

27
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,840
That's right, there's no laundry to wash so-

28
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,790
No.

29
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,930
I've got something right here if you want more to wash.

30
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,690
Why do you need to go out of your way to give us more work?!

31
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,430
And that means you too!

32
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:34,720
You know, a Japanese yukata looks rather effortless to strip off.

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,560
H-Hey!

34
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,280
So you don't normally wear any underwear, Kanzaki-san?{lol "So you are a flower that doesn't wear any underwear?"}{so you belong to the fraction who do not wear underwear?}

35
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,040
That's how you wear a yukata!

36
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,950
It hardly makes any noise.

37
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,300
You stripped just to see how it works...

38
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,630
Hey, Far East religious faction.

39
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,760
I'm technically not part of the faction at the moment, but how can I help you?

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,260
The instructions said "Please separate clothes with colors".{separate easily color fading (things that would transfer color to other things)}

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,140
What about your dyed Kimono sash?

42
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,520
Cancel... where's the cancel button?

43
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,740
You really aren't wearing anything down there.

44
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,580
Gekota! Gekota! Gekota! Gekota!

45
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,210
Sheesh...

46
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,220
Did you finish all the paperwork?

47
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,210
Heh?

48
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,180
It's not just Gekota?

49
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,640
It comes with Kyunko?!

50
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,980
AHH YAY!

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,650
So that would make you... Misaka Imouto?

52
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,240
"Yes," Misaka affirms, additionally stating the serial number 10032 for security.

53
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,870
I couldn't tell without your goggles.

54
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,740
Did you happen to see a Misaka of this height?

55
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,370
Misaka asks, raising her hand slightly below her chest.

56
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,710
You could change size?

57
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,380
"Judging from your reaction, it doesn't seem like you know."

58
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,880
Misaka says, discouraged by your uselessness.

59
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,680
"Misaka's goggles were stolen."

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,800
She must retrieve it immediately,

61
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,350
so Misaka demands for assistance using a persuasive expression.

62
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,900
Yeah, I might mistake you again without your goggles.

63
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,190
Maybe you can just take off your blazer or something?

64
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,530
Teh! How come you're taking your skirt off?!

65
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,770
No, no!

66
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,870
Don't take <i>that off!

67
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,530
Oh, I know.

68
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,330
Just find some sort of an accessory to wear, and you won't need goggles.

69
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,910
Accessory?

70
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,960
A ring, for example.

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,130
A ring?

72
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,100
If you put a ring you got from a man you love on your left ring finger,

73
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,800
you will be on the winning side, is what she found out secretly.

74
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,340
No, a ring won't do.

75
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,130
It's hardly noticeable.

76
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:16,060
Something that's more conspicuous.

77
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,770
Right now I'm playing tag with a lower stream Misaka.{an individual Misaka that is in a lower heiarchial position}

78
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:23,980
Misaka Misaka gives a situation update.

79
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,610
I won't be able to come home immediately.

80
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,730
I want you to make dinner, though.

81
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,610
Misaka Misaka makes an order too.

82
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,950
That damn brat.

83
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:40,620
It was our mistake to leave the room unattended.

84
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,960
If she had called our cells, we could've at least figure out where she went.

85
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,590
Let go, damn it!

86
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,670
Let go!

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,550
Well, just leave Kikyo to watch the house for now.

88
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,470
You're going out to look for her, aren't you?

89
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,600
If we can analyze the sounds we hear in the background,

90
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,350
we should be able to make a rough estimate of where she is.

91
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,980
Just leave it all to me.

92
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,110
Isn't that considered improper use of your job permissions?

93
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,240
Finding lost kids is also part of our job.{Might be plural.}

94
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,900
Anyway, let's go.

95
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,150
Damn.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,170
Ring...

97
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:21,540
Misaka needs one on the left ring finger.

98
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,250
Umm... If you don't like it, should I return it?

99
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,800
"Please don't take anything else away from Misaka."

100
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,540
Misaka says shyly in a small voice.

101
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,110
Oh?

102
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:37,320
Animal donuts.

103
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,260
They look delicious.

104
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,890
Say hi to papa!

105
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,730
"Chirp, chirp, chirp."

106
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,100
"They're smart chicks for not biting."

107
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,350
Misaka says in awe.

108
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,200
They said that they're a trial product in the experimental stage, but it's pretty good.

109
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,610
"Even if it is an experimental product,

110
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,120
"Misaka cannot take away{end?} the life of this chick..."

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,670
Why are you making sparks all around you?

112
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,520
Hey, what are you two doing?

113
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,500
Mi-Misaka...

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,470
"Misaka is here to retrieve the goggles that were stolen."

115
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,710
Misaka says-

116
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,930
"There are other reasons, but now Misaka is completely mesmerized by this frog."

117
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,230
Misaka ends the conversation.

118
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,180
Hey!

119
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,110
Give me an explanation.

120
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,030
Besides, you're not supposed to be here-

121
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,400
What is that?

122
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,740
Let me see!

123
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,700
"Onee-sama, you can keep your attention on the frog over there."

124
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,990
Misaka tells coldly.

125
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm just looking!

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,420
"If you want it so much, then you should get that person to buy it, just like Misaka did."

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,090
Misaka points out the person she is talking about.

128
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,170
That person?

129
00:08:55,190 --> 00:09:02,100
If I recall correctly, you lost in the battle so you were supposed to do anything I said as your punishment.

130
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,520
You are in the middle of <i>my punishment,

131
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,570
so how dare you fool around!

132
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,290
Are you so madly in love with little girls?!

133
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,150
"By the way, what are you doing here, Onee-sama?"

134
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:19,530
Misaka begins to gather information here.

135
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,530
Well...

136
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,330
We had some competition at the Daihaseisai.

137
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,740
And I won, so...

138
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,250
I'm dragging him around as his punishment.

139
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,580
And so it's like...

140
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,750
In short, you can't be true to yourself.

141
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,300
Misaka analyzes the information.

142
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,750
What?

143
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,090
What kind of analysis proves that?

144
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,140
It's not like I'm trying to hide anything.

145
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,980
By the way, what good does being honest with him bring?

146
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,850
Is that so?

147
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,690
Then, Misaka will choose a different path from her original.

148
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,860
Misaka naturally shows off the accessory he bought her to her original.

149
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,030
Misaka embraces from the other side.

150
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,960
Misaka Misaka tries to be included in something that looks interesting.

151
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,300
Misaka, you mean she's Imouto's Imouto?!

152
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,330
"Serial number 20001,

153
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,170
"How brave of you to actually show yourself infront of Misaka."

154
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,590
Misaka switches to serious mode quickly.

155
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,260
"Misaka is already bored with that game."

156
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,810
Misaka Misaka goes off in excavation of new entertainment.

157
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,520
"Did you think you could escape?"

158
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,060
Misaka takes out a rifle from her bag.

159
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,190
"You call that being serious?"

160
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,110
Misaka Misaka makes a fool out of you.

161
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,740
The true stage is about to come.

162
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,240
Misaka develops to final stage as Misaka full boost.

163
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,330
What the heck?

164
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,790
Underground city?

165
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,160
In the voicemail, we detected inaudible low-frequency sound waves used for tracing.{they seem to make these low sounds so that people can trace them with sound spectrum analysis like this}

166
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,720
The frequency was for Area U.

167
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,100
In other words, underground city.

168
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,940
And you're saying I should go there?

169
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,320
For now.

170
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:22,030
We don't know if the little troublemaker is still there though.

171
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,570
Hey, Accelerator.

172
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,950
What is it?

173
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,120
Is it so fearful to show affection to someone else?

174
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,200
Say what?

175
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,000
You seem to accept the love from Last Order.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,440
But you refuse to show affection to her from your side.

177
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,590
Because you are afraid of it having undesirable outcomes and causing something that can never be overturned.

178
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,180
Are you giving me a lesson?

179
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:47,400
It's not like someone like me would understand what darkness you have.

180
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,390
But since you used to be at a certain place before...{but since the place you have been is out of all the places}

181
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,270
You mean the Tokuryokuken{?}{special power lab}.

182
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,190
Special case ability user repeated control technology laboratory.

183
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,280
I was thrown in there until 9.

184
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,030
That place is a shit hole to get rid of living humans{in/at/from}{Possibly TLC}.

185
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,370
You probably heard about it at least.

186
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:12,920
It was my unit that conquered and razed the place.

187
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,170
Thank you for that.

188
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,790
I saw it as well.

189
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,210
That thing that was lying behind the heavy door.

190
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,590
I was a monster that even the special ability lab couldn't deal with.

191
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,170
Yoshikawa must have told you.

192
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,720
I've been through hell in those experiments.

193
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,930
I can't show affection.

194
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,900
Yet, you hate yourself for being like that.

195
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,720
Am I wrong?

196
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,520
This is a rule I put on myself:

197
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,530
I don't aim my weapon against children.

198
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,160
Whether or not they are ability users.

199
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,660
Can you make a guess as to why?

200
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,830
It's just as you imagine.

201
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,540
Sure, it might be nothing compared to your case.

202
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,290
But it's no different in the sense that we both carry a loan.

203
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,470
Then, even how pitiful it looks, we still have to keep paying up{back}.

204
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,850
You have the power to pull through, something I lack.

205
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,720
You have several aces up your sleeve.

206
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,570
If only I had stopped the experiment with this ability,{TLC}

207
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,410
If I were able to stop them as they marched on the path of death,

208
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,400
If it's still not too late...

209
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,650
If...

210
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,700
How stupid.

211
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,370
A pile of the stupid things,

212
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,490
pays back the loan.

213
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,870
Shit hole.

214
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,810
Is this what was reported?

215
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,270
It's a quite well-built hologram.

216
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,480
Geez, someone is putting so much effort into a prank.

217
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,150
Let's report to the headquarters and scan out for ability users that would fit this description{ability description}.

218
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,270
Geez.

219
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,940
What was that about?

220
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,070
Damn {fucking }bastard!{Is it really okay to swear?}

221
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,490
What does he think promises are?!

222
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,250
I don't get it.

223
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,090
I don't get it at all.

224
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,420
What misfortune.

225
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,880
What, are you having your shoulders down in tiredness?

226
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,460
Huh?

227
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,300
Misaka Misaka-

228
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,100
Attaches to your back as a refreshing type mascot character.

229
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,840
Hey!

230
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,060
You are that...

231
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,520
Mini-Misaka from before?

232
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,530
Touma...

233
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,030
Huh?

234
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:57,030
What is this?

235
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,250
And...

236
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:06,630
I was looking for Touma but I got hungry on my way, and you see...

237
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,670
Don't eat while you talk.

238
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,470
And don't you have something to tell me?

239
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,010
Yes, thank you.

240
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,770
Just one simple word?

241
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,600
You see, my name is Index.

242
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,770
Introducing yourself with such a dirty face...

243
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,840
Have you seen anyone like her?

244
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,110
Nope.

245
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,320
A quick reply that was.

246
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,040
Because I never forget the face of someone I've seen only once.

247
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,870
But boy was I in luck.

248
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,380
Now I can go find Touma without worrying about an empty stomach.

249
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:51,210
Although I don't have much of a reason to find him now that I'm full.

250
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,380
Oh, cool.

251
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,140
I'm not helping.

252
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,510
Ask someone else.

253
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,390
Are you busy?

254
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,390
Yeah.

255
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,390
I'm very busy, unfortunately.

256
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,600
So you say.

257
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,770
You are like the host computer that leads the Imoutos?

258
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,190
"I'm more of a console than the host."

259
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,070
Corrects Misaka Misaka.

260
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,450
There is no center of Misakas.

261
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,830
There is no real meaning of a certain individual to be a core in the network.

262
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,910
Misaka Misaka lectures proudly.

263
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,170
"Umm, you see,

264
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,000
"since you helped Misaka during the experiment,

265
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,550
"I came to thank you."

266
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,510
TL-Note: "Tsuru no Ongaeshi" means contract of retribution of a favor
Misaka Misaka proposes a story development like Tsuru no Ongaeshi.{TL NOTE:"Tsuru no Ongaeshi" means contract of retribution of a favor}

267
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:38,300
Cool.
TL-Note: "Tsuru no Ongaeshi" means contract of retribution of a favor

268
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,670
What are you really here for?
TL-Note: "Tsuru no Ongaeshi" means contract of retribution of a favor

269
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,850
TL-Note: "Tsuru no Ongaeshi" means contract of retribution of a favor

270
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,850
"You don't even believe me for a second."

271
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,850
Misaka Misaka stomps in rage.

272
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,600
And swings her arms around.

273
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,400
Sorry, sorry.

274
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,610
I'm really sorry.

275
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,480
I will buy that for you.

276
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,400
So forgive me.

277
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,410
"You think something as easy as food can win over the complicated heart of a girl?"

278
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:02,240
Misaka Misaka appears to look depressed.

279
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,000
And you see,

280
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,040
Touma keeps leaving me to go off on his own.

281
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,380
You can say he has some habit of wandering off.

282
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,080
He's the type of person who's basically always on a journey.

283
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,220
By the way, what are you doing here?

284
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,390
Searching for someone.

285
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,100
Do you mean the girl on your phone?

286
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,390
What about her?

287
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,350
Come to think of it, I haven't thanked you yet.

288
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,930
Just keep quiet and go home already, you little brat.

289
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,100
I haven't thanked you yet, have I.

290
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,690
Don't ignore what I said, damn it!

291
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,440
You mean that girl, right?

292
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,820
I'll help you find her until I find Touma.

293
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,130
Huh?

294
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,320
Okay?

295
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,530
Shit hole.

296
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,460
You see.

297
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,290
Huh?

298
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,870
"Misaka stole this."

299
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,170
Misaka Misaka shows off the war booty.

300
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,920
What is that?

301
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,680
You claim that you're a bandit after a little rest{now}?

302
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,800
And those goggles...

303
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,520
It's the one Misaka Imouto was looking for.

304
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,100
"But this one wasn't made for me,"

305
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,180
"so it doesn't fit properly."

306
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Misaka Misaka tries to seem a little sad.

307
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,980
Don't you just need to adjust the band length?

308
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,320
Huh?

309
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,830
A-Are you all right?

310
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,080
Hmm.

311
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,710
I seem to have{It feels like I have} seen this face somewhere.

312
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,830
But it seems a little too small.

313
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,300
But I didn't see her before after all.

314
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,590
Then give that back.

315
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,670
You needless brat.

316
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,060
Okay finished.

317
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,010
"Oh.

318
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,560
"Now it fits me."

319
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,320
Misaka Misaka looks impressed.

320
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,100
"But the price I had to pay wasn't small at all."

321
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,690
Misaka Misaka remembers that but still expresses enjoyment physically.

322
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,610
Yeah, sure.

323
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,830
"You see.

324
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,420
"Misaka has to go home now."

325
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,800
Misaka Misaka gives an unfortunate announcement.

326
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,540
Oh.

327
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,460
It's quite late after all.

328
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,720
"To be frank, I want to spend more time with you."

329
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,270
Miaka Misaka tries to be sad.

330
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,680
"It was a coincidence we met here,

331
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,220
"but I honestly wanted to properly thank you."

332
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,520
Misaka Misaka expresses how she feels.

333
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,120
"But that person would be worried about me."

334
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,950
That person?

335
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:44,880
"He might come searching for me if I'm very late.

336
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,910
"I don't want to trouble him either."

337
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,870
Misaka Misaka says while laughing.

338
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,040
I see.

339
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,120
That person seems like a nice guy then.

340
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,960
"He's weak.

341
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,250
"He has been injured a lot.

342
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,590
"Not only could he not defend those within his hands.

343
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,630
"His hands that were saving them are in shreds as well.

344
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,360
"So I don't want to make things more difficult for him.

345
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,060
"So Misaka will defend him this time."

346
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,300
Misaka Misaka reveals.

347
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,100
I see.

348
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,320
Oh, it's Touma.

349
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,950
The guy you were searching for?

350
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,570
Yes.

351
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,240
Oh.

352
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:34,290
Damn.

353
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,960
Go on.{Continue.}

354
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,370
But what about your acquaintance?

355
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:39,840
Don't worry,

356
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,290
I found her just now.

357
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,710
Then I will be going now.

358
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:44,790
Thank you.

359
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,760
Last Order!

360
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,890
Touma.

361
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,350
"I'm back!"

362
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,230
Misaka Misaka performs the regular greeting.

363
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,700
"Ouch!

364
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,660
"Why are you repeatedly giving me chops without saying anything?"

365
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,790
Misaka Misaka holds her head and pretends to cry.

366
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:15,110
Rather, what have you been doing until now?

367
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,500
"I was playing with someone."

368
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,540
Misaka Misaka answers honestly.

369
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,510
Huh?

370
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,420
Touma, Touma!

371
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,630
I finally found you.

372
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,420
Why are you here?

373
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,010
You see,

374
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,140
that person helped me while I was in a critical state.

375
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,840
Which person?

376
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,850
Accelerator!

377
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,940
I will leave you if you don't hurry.

378
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,650
Damn.

379
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,780
Shut your trap.

380
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,990
Stupid brat.
