1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
{Index 12}

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,760
Oriana Thomson continues her escape in Academy City, right in the midst of the Daihaseisai.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,180
Stiyl and I ran after Oriana Thomson, but she outsmarted us.

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,090
Tsuchimikado then became a target of hers.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,380
Furthermore, even Himegami was dragged into it by mere coincidence.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,610
Damn it, now I'm definitely going to beat Oriana to death.

7
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,300
<b>Belvedere</b>

8
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
Damn it!

9
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:08,050
Tsuchimikado, I'm sorry. I lost track of Oriana.

10
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,690
Do you know where she's heading?

11
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:16,110
This bus seems to go around the 7th district.

12
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,910
The problem is where she'll get off.

13
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,290
Wait a minute.

14
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,370
What is it, Kami-yan?

15
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,380
Why is Oriana walking around the city?

16
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,450
Huh?

17
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,450
It's because we've been chasing after her{pursuing her around}, so-

18
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,140
That's not it.

19
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:30,750
Before that.

20
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,790
Since there wasn't a transaction of the Croce di Pietro in the first place.

21
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,230
So it wasn't to meet someone.

22
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,070
Wouldn't loitering around the city just increase her risk?

23
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,260
So there must be{there is} a reason Oriana is moving independently, right?

24
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,850
Reason?

25
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:53,820
I don't know that much; she could be searching for the conditions to use the Croce di Pietro.

26
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,070
Conditions?

27
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,610
Maybe she can only use it under specific circumstances?

28
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,930
Stiyl was looking into that, but...

29
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,070
Come to think of it,

30
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,600
there was a message from Orsola.

31
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll forward it your way.

32
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,220
I've got it, Kami-yan.

33
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,220
It seems to be a report related to the cleanup of the vault of the Croce di Pietro.

34
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,730
So what's written there?

35
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:34,730
When they were putting the Croce di Pietro away, they were careful to not expose it to sunlight.

36
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,530
Light?

37
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,730
I'm sure it's to prevent it from accidentally activating.{unnecessary activation.}

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,490
In other words, it will activate if it's exposed to sunlight?

39
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,160
If that's the case, they would have activated it long ago.

40
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,330
Besides, it was written that the massive cleanup should end before evening.

41
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,750
In other words, it's not related to time?

42
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,910
No.

43
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,820
But it seems there was a problem with the owner.

44
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:00,210
During office hours, the owner seemed to be using astrology involving horoscopes to predict the future.

45
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,660
Astrology?

46
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:07,080
If they were doing the cleanup before evening, were they concerned with the lights at night?

47
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,180
Like maybe the stars in the sky?

48
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:17,930
Certainly if they use the patterns of the night sky, they can create a magical circle of astronomical powers.

49
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:39,540
If the Croce di Pietro is like a receiver that assimilates light from the stars,

50
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:45,340
then Oriana is looking for the most suitable place to set up the receiver.

51
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,580
But the date Peter died is the 29th of June.

52
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't forget the longitude and latitude is different in Japan.

53
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
If they can't solve this problem, our constellation theory is still weak.

54
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,690
Well, there's no more time to think about that.

55
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,520
Anyway, let's move.

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,170
Under the assumption that she's using the constellations, then our time limit shall be...{our time limit}

57
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,520
Sunset, huh?

58
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,100
In that case, what should I do?

59
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,560
Touma.

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
What are you doing in this kind of place?

61
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,550
I-Index?

62
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,980
It would seem that Kanzaki Kaori didn't come after all.

63
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:45,880
Lidvia.

64
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,160
I know what you're trying to say.

65
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:52,020
The girl you hurt was just a civilian.

66
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:01,290
Her name is Himegami Aisa, a person who holds very important powers, though she isn't really a magician.

67
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,130
That Celtic Cross merely served to seal her powers.

68
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,020
She doesn't have any attack power.

69
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,220
We are terrible.{We are the worst}

70
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,580
Indeed, we are.

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,320
We bared fangs to people who are unrelated to magic.

72
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,560
And this isn't the first time.

73
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:26,390
Those people are{Kamijou and his friends are people} lost sinners seeking salvation whom we should protect.

74
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,820
We cannot make any more mistakes from now onwards.

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,540
Also for her sake, we must use the Croce di Pietro and take over Academy City.

76
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,380
Will everything proceed smoothly?

77
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,140
If we take control of Academy City...

78
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,660
can we really solve everyone's problems?

79
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,700
Touma, why aren't you with your classmates?

80
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,860
Ever since mid-afternoon you haven't been participating in the events.

81
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,680
Why?

82
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,070
Oh, I was helping the administrative committee.

83
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,110
That's weird, I sent an e-mail to everyone in class...

84
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,150
An e-mail?

85
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,780
Was it out of range?

86
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,800
Or did the transmission not reach the center?

87
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,240
Either way, Index, please head over to where everyone is.

88
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,510
Touma, Touma, the next event is the group gymnastics.

89
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:20,780
Will you come?

90
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,350
I'll go, as fast as possible.

91
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,710
Once I'm done helping out.

92
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,300
I'll definitely go, so will you please go on ahead?

93
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,580
Please, Index?

94
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,230
Sure!

95
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,030
Sorry, Kami-yan.

96
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:46,010
Let's end this 'help' quickly.

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,320
Though I said that, with so many people...

98
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,860
Wait, says Misaka as she says as she chases after.

99
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:04,410
Why not, argues Misaka as she argues as she was just looking for a souvenir!

100
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,710
Misaka?

101
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,170
Hello, is this Stiyl?

102
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,040
I finished tending to the female student.

103
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,720
What about Himegami?

104
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,910
I don't want to use that spell again.

105
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,520
Anyway, her mind's at rest now, at least.

106
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,740
The rest is up to the doctor.

107
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,430
You...

108
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,180
What's with that whimsical tone of yours?

109
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,940
I don't have the slightest intention of getting along w-

110
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,200
I haven't properly thanked you yet.

111
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,930
If you weren't there, Himegami-chan would have...

112
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,160
She would have...

113
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,690
Cut that out.

114
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,210
We're still not certain that she's out of danger yet.

115
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:50,140
I still want to-! Want to thank-!

116
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,600
It seems you're busy right now, so let's save it for later.

117
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,040
Contact Tsuchimikado!

118
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,950
It seems like he's onto something.

119
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:00,460
I'll also be on my way once I get her off of me.

120
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,400
Looks like I hit the jackpot.

121
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,190
If that's the case...

122
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,030
How will that inconsistency be solved?

123
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,650
Ah, Fukiyose-chan, are you all right?

124
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,240
I'm fine.

125
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,340
More importantly, is everything OK at the festival?

126
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,920
Well, Himegami-chan was in big trouble there.

127
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,010
What? Don't tell me those idiots did something again!

128
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,510
Actually, she was attacked by someone, so she was taken to the hospital.

129
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,470
She was attacked?

130
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:48,410
It might have turned out really bad if Kamijou and the others weren't there.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,200
Ah, the priest just ran by!

132
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,280
Priest!

133
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,020
Priest...?

134
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,910
What on earth is happening in this city?

135
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,000
I see.

136
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,020
So it means that the key to activate it lies within the constellation.

137
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,450
But you know,

138
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:14,030
the last time the Croce di Pietro was used was during summer.

139
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,470
I don't think it could be substituted with the autumn constellation.

140
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,440
There must be more to it.

141
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,300
A gimmick that we haven't figured out yet.

142
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,090
But we don't have the time to wrack our brains on that.

143
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,480
It's from the Anglican Church...

144
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,070
Is this Stiyl Magnus-san's number?{since this is prob not a call from... Japan? Or is it?}

145
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,740
WRONG NUMBER!{BITCH!}

146
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm very sorry! {you are so needless}

147
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,190
That voice... Is that you, Orsola?

148
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,740
Oh my, it's you.

149
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,490
You really helped me there the other day.

150
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,820
Thanks to you, I was able to quickly get used to this place.

151
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,750
If you have something to inform us, I'd like you to hurry up and tell us.

152
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
Yes, of course.

153
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,310
The place that Kanzaki-san showed me the other day where you can eat delicious Japanese dishes was-

154
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:03,350
Now give us the information already!

155
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,060
I understood the conditions on how the Croce di Pietro can be used.

156
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,760
It is a large scale magical device that makes use of the constellation's power.

157
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,830
Sorry we already know that.

158
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,820
Is that so?

159
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,120
You must also know that it can be used regardless of the season and anyplace on the planet right?

160
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,660
I thought we succeeded when Sherry and I found it.

161
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,630
Wait elaborate on that topic.

162
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,260
In order to use the Croce di Pietro, the unique characteristics of the area in question have to be understood.

163
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:49,640
Afterwards, the most appropriate one of the 88 constellations has to be chosen. With that, the conditions would finally be met.{(add) With that, the conditions are finally met.}

164
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,880
In other words...

165
00:11:52,190 --> 00:12:02,560
Yes, there are many limitations, but in reality it is possible for the Roman Catholic church to reign anywhere in the world.

166
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm beginning to understand.

167
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,230
Basically, Peter didn't restrict his monument to the specific place of his martyrdom.{the place of his martyrdom}

168
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,410
But even if he could pick his own location, what about the date?

169
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,450
Peter was executed on the 29th of June.

170
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,270
It was also the date when the Croce di Pietro could have been used in the Vatican.

171
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,670
So he purposely got caught on that date,

172
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,240
knowing he could be killed?

173
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,700
It's not entirely impossible.

174
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:37,510
So Orsola, today is the 19th of September, have you understood the point of using the Croce di Pietro in Japan?

175
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,880
Yes, definitely.

176
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,840
Ah look, look Mikoto-chan, a pseudo five-dimensional kaleidoscope.{psuedo five dimentional}

177
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,910
How interesting!

178
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,750
Stop looking at something so stupid.

179
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,330
Look for something that'll be more memorable.

180
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,740
My, you're so cute.

181
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,670
Shut up, stupid mother.

182
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,970
This viscous stare I feel...{this viscous}

183
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:16,270
Is... Is she someone from your family, Onee-sama?

184
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,500
Unbelievable!

185
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,560
This is an overwhelming sensation of Onee-sama's aura!{This is a great inflation of the Oneesama aura!}

186
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,330
Now you've done it.

187
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,100
I must make my unyielding decision!

188
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,060
I'll take you both on, simultaneously{italicize please}!

189
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,850
Hey Kuroko, you're...

190
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,640
Mikoto-chan, I didn't know you swung that way.

191
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,410
Wait, but I don't!

192
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,110
Come on Kuroko, get a grip of reality already.

193
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,740
Woman, wake up!

194
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,040
Morning! Rise and shine!

195
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,850
Oh my. It's that boy...

196
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,510
In that case, Oriana was testing if those locations work, right?

197
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,320
Yeah.

198
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,590
All the points we've checked had skyscrapers and buildings blocking the vision of the sky.

199
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,660
There's only one place left.

200
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,930
I'm certain she'll come this way.

201
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,400
The experimental airport in the 23rd District?

202
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,420
There's nothing there to block the sky.

203
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,880
Sorry for being{I'm} late.

204
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,020
Goodness, what in the world is she?

205
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:31,430
I used dispel magic on her, but once she was out of the effective radius, she came after me again.

206
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,460
Anyway, what's our plan?

207
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,230
The 23rd District is heavily guarded.

208
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,100
Can we even infiltrate it?

209
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:41,510
Well, let's just say...

210
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,940
I'll just make use of my special privilege, though it's only limited to this occasion.

211
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,510
Privilege?

212
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,240
This is weird.

213
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,670
We'll begin to administer the finishing touches now.{We'll start doing the finishing touches now.}

214
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,790
I believe there's still some time before the designated time.

215
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:03,170
The security here is acting in an unusual way.

216
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,830
It appears that they've discovered that I'm nearby.

217
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,760
Then Belvedere's position as well...

218
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,610
Perhaps so.

219
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,390
But this is still the most suitable position.

220
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,110
After all, we won't get civilians involved at this location.

221
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,610
In that case...

222
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,270
Yes.

223
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,150
Make preparations over on your side.

224
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,110
I'll lay waste to the Academy City...

225
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,100
Right here.

226
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,940
Just like kicking the maiden of light, who've known nothing at all, into a pool of mud.{wut<<<}{lol, it's right; it's prob supposed to be a metaphor with some historical event}

227
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,220
I asked for security at the 23rd District to be altered a bit.

228
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,630
I'm going to take advantage of the chaos.

229
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,780
Croce di Pietro's activation will happen right after sunset.

230
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,090
Most likely between 6PM to 7PM.

231
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,980
It will take 10 minutes to get to the 23rd District airport railway station.

232
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,180
This means that after we get there, we'll only have 25 minutes until it's 6.

233
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,900
Just for confirmation's sake,

234
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,720
do you intend to face Oriana in your current state?

235
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,650
As much as I'd like to take a break...

236
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:08,940
23rd District's security isn't so light that weaklings like you can break through by yourselves.

237
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,900
I see...

238
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,790
There's no turning back once we board this train.

239
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,920
Only a bloodbath awaits us, nothing more.

240
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,630
Kamijou Touma, are you prepared?

241
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,870
Yeah. I'm going to bring an end to this.

242
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,250
One more thing...

243
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,140
What is it?

244
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,130
Remember this.

245
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,310
I have no intention of letting this end in a bloodbath.

246
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:55,950
Is Touma missing?

247
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,920
Um...

248
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,980
What do you mean?

249
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,350
I'm really sorry!

250
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:04,350
Your son has been assigned to my care.

251
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,430
By right, I know I should know of his whereabouts.

252
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,010
There's something I'd like to ask.

253
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes, what is it?

254
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,170
Touma is acting on his own initiative, isn't he?

255
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,430
He's not being forced to.

256
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:21,180
Yes, that's right.

257
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,690
So that means it's something more meaningful to him than attending events.{events}

258
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,400
I see no reason to stop him, I guess?

259
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,670
Yup.

260
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,780
Turn this sky into a roof.

261
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
So as to bring peace to this land.

262
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,220
Come forth, the blessings of the Twelve Apostles.

263
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,730
The security here is based in the sky.

264
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,900
Being as there's almost no place to hide.

265
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,510
How's Oriana going to get into the airport then?

266
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,200
I bet she's already got something set up.

267
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,640
Tsuchimikado.

268
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,450
We're short on time here.

269
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,430
I know.

270
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,040
We're going to use that.

271
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,130
This place is close to a normal airport.

272
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:32,000
The sky is crowded with passenger planes and experimental planes.

273
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,530
In order to avoid aerial collisions, their patrol plane changes routes accordingly.

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,470
If we effectively use the blind spots, we should be able to manage.{If we effectively use blind spots, we should somewhat manage.}

275
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,070
Wait! Tsuchimikado!

276
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,470
What's up, Kami-yan?

277
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,320
Tsuchimikado!

278
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,120
Are you okay, Tsuchimikado?

279
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,330
Go, Kami-yan...

280
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,320
Destroy that page.

281
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,540
Both of you, go ahead...

282
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,170
What about you?

283
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:15,050
Stiyl, can't you heal him with your magic?

284
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,950
You think she's going to wait for us?

285
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,260
Kamijou Touma!

286
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,700
Fire, at my palm.

287
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,770
Form into a blade, and judge my foe!

288
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,450
Hurry up!

289
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,930
That saint isn't coming after all, is she?

290
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:55,000
That means there's only the three of you to deal with.

291
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:58,820
A barrier?

292
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,420
She must have severed all forms of communication.{She must have cut off all forms of communication}

293
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:06,760
Stiyl!

294
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,230
Oh my.

295
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:18,100
You can't make me come if you're distracted.{sexual}

296
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,280
Break!

297
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,440
Your hips give way too easily.

298
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:34,010
I'm going to stop you here.

299
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,330
I won't let you use Croce di Pietro.

300
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,550
You're going to destroy the Academy City and mess up the Daihaseisai, right?

301
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,300
I'll definitely stop you!

302
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:46,930
Destroy? That's a harsh way of putting it.

303
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:54,620
Croce di Pietro will remove the wall between magic and science, and it may well bring happiness to everyone in this world.

304
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,460
Happiness? That sure sounds nice.

305
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,560
I know that's a nice word, but...

306
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,900
What bothers me the most is that you're going to use the Croce di Pietro to put an end to the Daihaseisai!

307
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:13,460
Do you know how many people treasure the Daihaseisai?

308
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:27,100
Regardless of what great religion you use as an excuse, you have no right to rob people of their enjoyment.{the people's feelings.,anticipation for this Daihaseisai)}

309
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,050
Do you think you can talk me out of it with some half-assed emotional speech?

310
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:37,190
If that could faze me, I would have never started this.

311
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,980
Can you still say that in front of Fukiyose and Himegami whom you have injured?{(add) that you hurt}

312
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,900
That's all I want to say.

313
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,560
But, if you're going to do something in this city,

314
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,990
I'll destroy your illusions until not a single fragment remains!

322

When science and magic cross path, the story begins.
