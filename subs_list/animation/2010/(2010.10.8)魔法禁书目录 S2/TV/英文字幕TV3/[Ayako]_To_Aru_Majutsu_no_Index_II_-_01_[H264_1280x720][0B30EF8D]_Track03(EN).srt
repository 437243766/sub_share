00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,250
Oh! God damn it! {marsd note: original in braces and we use BrE}

2
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,750
The neccesary conditions for an ESP-card experiment?

3
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:31,170
How would a Level Zero Kamijou-san know that?

4
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,610
Imagine Breaker, the mysterious ability residing in my right hand...

5
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,440
It seems that any unnatural power will be cancelled just being in contact with it.

6
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,420
But this 'oh-so-wonderful' ability holds no benefits{has no benefit} towards the summer vacation homework.

7
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,590
August the 31st

8
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,410
To make matters worse, Misaka Mikoto forced me to pretend to be her boyfriend on that day... {Even worse on a day like this, I got forced to pretend to be a boyfriend by Misaka Mikoto,}
August the 31st

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,650
To make matters worse, Misaka Mikoto forced me to pretend to be her boyfriend on that day... {Even worse on a day like this, I got forced to pretend to be a boyfriend by Misaka Mikoto,}

10
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,620
...while some Aztec magician chased after me...

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,960
...and many horrible incidents happened subsequently ...

12
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:14,690
The result? I've{The result was that I have} effectively finished none of my homework.

13
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,700
I see.

14
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,430
So in Magical Powered Kanamin,{<- name of show}

15
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:27,490
they use plastic to replicate 'Lotus Wand' and 'Parts of Ether in Elemental.'{<- dont ask me}

16
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,520
The Japanese way of doing things sure is magnificent. {ty}

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,150
Uhh, Index-san, {do we want honorifics in this series?}
The Japanese way of doing things sure is magnificent. {ty}

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,990
I won't tell you to stop watching TV,

19
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,530
but please keep the volume low at leas-

20
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,220
Touma won't play with me at all!

21
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,420
That's why I'm immersing myself in{escaping into} the world of television!!!

22
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Ouch!

23
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,160
Damn! Why are you always giving me more stuff to do when I'm so short on time?

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,790
Huh?

25
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,800
Hey where did my half-finished worksheet go?

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,480
Where did my classic literature workbook go? And my math reference book?!

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,840
Oh, Touma!

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,350
Did you find it?!

29
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,430
It's already past three o'clock.

30
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,200
Huh?

31
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,150
I'd like some snacks!

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,110
What misfortune...

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,040
Index Librorvm Prohibitorvm... {HOLY SHIT it actually exists www.odan.org/index_forbidden_books.doc}

34
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,510
The Index of Forbidden Books, eh?

37
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,510
Oh my, what an arduous task of finding the worksheet under a mountain of comic books.

38
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,900
So Touma, aren't I worthy of praise?

39
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,560
Aren't I?

40
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,670
Don't you have something you need to say to me?{You should have something you need to say to me, right?}

41
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,210
Don't you?

42
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,980
What are you trying to imply{ say}? {get to - juz cuz >implying brb pee}

43
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:23,330
I did a lot of work, so I want proper compensation.

44
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,720
Actually, I want something to eat.

45
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,350
You just had{ate} pudding, including mine{y portion}!

46
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,940
Oh! That looks nice!

I've said{Like I said,} I have no time to make that stuff!

50
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,750
Currently it's past five in the evening and just about seven hours before the day is over.{change of the day. change of day is fucking weird phrase but w/e}

51
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,170
Even if I pull an all-nighter, I have less than fifteen hours before I have to go to school.

52
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,880
With just this little{much} time left...

53
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,800
Touma,
With just this little{much} time left...

54
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,800
It's bad for your health to{wrong to} work under so much stress.

55
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,560
Your mind might slip to a{ become an even} worse state if you're so stressed.{ get so worked up.}

56
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,480
Don't overwork yourself.

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,440
You're the last person I want to hear that from!{to tell me that.}

58
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,900
This is {So here's }the place.

Bow of Striking!

61
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,480
Not here...

62
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,840
I just had a bad feeling about something{I sense something bad happening}...

63
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,940
Hey Touma!

64
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,780
Can I order anything?

65
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,500
What?

66
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,890
Just what do you want?

67
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,160
Then...

68
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,120
The most expensive thing?

69
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,570
So you want 2,000 yen worth of raw eggs...

70
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:57,200
Touma!

71
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,240
Index and I, Kamijou Touma went to a family restaurant for a change of environment.

72
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:07,790
I assumed I started my battle against the remaining forces of summer vacation homework...{O_O?}

73
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,060
Thank you for waitin-ah-

74
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,490
Here!

75
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,950
I will now enter the battlefield.

76
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,910
My report for Introduction to Ability Development...

77
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,380
Uhh... I'll bring something to wipe it off right away!

78
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,880
B-But Touma, it's still legible...

79
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,870
You only have to copy it onto a new sheet of paper.{essay paper}
I already wrote three pages...

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,960
You only have to copy it onto a new sheet of paper.{essay paper}

81
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,340
You're lucky that you don't have to think up of the content afresh{from the beginning}.

82
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,600
I now declare the start {shall announce the beginning }of battle!

83
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,100
Bow of Destructive Magic!

84
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,660
Why you!

85
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,530
What are you doing-

86
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,200
I'm over here!

87
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,290
I did not foresee this outcome{expect this result}, but I will be glad with{shall be happy there is going to be} only a few{less} needless casualties.{inb4 NEEDLESS... oops}

88
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,270
I will not harm you if{If} you surrender now.{, I won't do any harm to you.}

89
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,790
If I attain what I came here for-

90
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,760
M-My homework got turned into{became} confetti!

91
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,350
Hey! You there!

92
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,820
Take responsibility for what you did!{You did this, so take responsibility!}

93
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,700
Redo my homework!

94
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,900
It's none of my business.

95
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,860
Okay.

96
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,160
Kamijou-san is somewhat violent today.

97
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,030
Oh, huh?

98
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,300
I will finish the job quickly.

99
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,290
I do not wish to participate in child's play.

100
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,560
What are you thinking?

101
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,750
What are you going to do with Index?

102
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,120
You should already understand.

103
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,690
If you know that this is the Index of Forbidden books with 103,000 books in its memory.

104
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,470
You are a magician!

105
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,890
Indeed.{filled by timer}

106
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,390
Bow of Transparent Magic!

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,010
Hey, you bastard!

108
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,930
I just grabbed hold of something small and soft!

109
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,350
Are you there, Index?

110
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,620
Wh-What?!

111
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,890
Damn it! He got away!

112
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,610
Excuse me, dear customer... {we are here to sell you lots of cheap gold.}

113
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,410
Although I didn't give her have a phone for such situations...

114
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,170
Of course, she wouldn't pick up.

115
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,330
Damn! Where should I look?

116
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,970
Hey!

117
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,930
Hey, where are you going Sphinx?

118
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,640
Wait for me!

119
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,250
A hotel?

120
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,210
Could she be in there?{Don't tell me she's kept in there.}

121
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,670
Over there{Is she that way}, Sphinx?

122
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,530
There?

123
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,860
Index!

124
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,010
Damn you!

125
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't you have the least bit of gratitude towards your owner?!

126
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,000
Whatever the circumstances, it was Index who found you!

127
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,470
Let's keep searching.

128
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,240
I'm surprised.

129
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,910
You've already removed two knots in this short period of time.

130
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,740
The culture of using ropes in torture originated in Japan.{Using ropes is an original torture culture invented in Japan.}

131
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:11,690
You won't be able to force anything out of me by using such a crude method.{But with such a crude method, you can't make me speak. **}

132
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,260
I've said before that my goal is not to torture you.

133
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,090
I only wish to acquire a volume from the collection of magic books within you.{From the magic books within you, I just want to have one volume from the collection.}

134
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,400
Now...

135
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,210
I'll first have to create an amplifying magic boundary.{First I need to make a magic boundary for amplification.}

136
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,900
If you bought this you were ripped off.

137
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,170
Just what is that magician planning to do with Index?{What is that magician going to do to Index?}

138
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,440
Damn it!

139
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,500
Where should I be searching?

140
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,080
Sorry!

141
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,220
Hey, what are you doing here?

142
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,140
You always seem to be running about somewhere.{It looks like you're always running around.}

143
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,270
At least let me know if you're doing all right!{tell me you're doing all right if you are so!}

144
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:18,150
Oh right, you don't have{didn't know} my number...

145
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,650
Huh?!

146
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,950
Geez!

147
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,570
You're always like this.

148
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,330
Quit acting stupid-

149
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:33,830
Oh, huh?

150
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,950
Why do you look like you're just about to cry?

151
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,290
I'm in a hurry, like a real hurry!

152
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,770
Homework, kidnapping and some incident at the restaurant and other stuff!!!

153
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,990
Hurry, what's your business?

154
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:45,170
Oh, what?

155
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,530
N-No... Just that...

156
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:55,670
I was just annoyed that you ignored me and...

157
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,190
It's nothing serious or anything but... nothing serious...

158
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,660
Sorry!

159
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,150
Hey! You're really leaving me here like this?!

160
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,280
Hey!

161
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,950
Note: Kagura - Spiritual music and dancing as an offering to the gods
Is this supposed to be a Kagura stage?{need explanation for Kagura? orz spiritual music and dancing as an offering to the gods}

162
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:13,800
It is nothing that great.
Note: Kagura - Spiritual music and dancing as an offering to the gods

163
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,790
It would only pass to be the dance stage of a summer festival at best.{It's rather a summer festival dance stage at best.}
Note: Kagura - Spiritual music and dancing as an offering to the gods

164
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,080
It would only pass to be the dance stage of a summer festival at best.{It's rather a summer festival dance stage at best.}

165
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,800
Are you going to have something possess me by preparing that?

166
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:29,590
My purpose for creating this magic boundary is to increase this thing's ability.

167
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,680
An Azusa bow?{azusa = catalpa}

168
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,510
It's a ceremonial object used in Shinto practise.

169
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,170
Amazing.

170
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,520
You even cover the cultural traditions of the East.

171
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,280
Against that magic book library of yours...

172
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,540
...this ability will only be able to jolt your mind and correct distortions at best with its original scale of power.
Index!

173
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,230
Index!
...this ability will only be able to jolt your mind and correct distortions at best with its original scale of power.

174
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,650
...this ability will only be able to jolt your mind and correct distortions at best with its original scale of power.

175
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,050
Hey Index, where are you now?!
...this ability will only be able to jolt your mind and correct distortions at best with its original scale of power.

176
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,990
...this ability will only be able to jolt your mind and correct distortions at best with its original scale of power.

177
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,670
However under the right conditions{all set right}, it can read the opponents mind in detail.

178
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,770
Yes... I can even reveal those 103,000 books you secretly hold in your mind.

179
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,100
No you mustn't!

180
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,830
Surely, you know what will happen when someone other than myself comes in contact with the magic books!

181
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,810
Of course.

182
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,890
I couldn't be more sure.

183
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,260
What was that?

184
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,890
That hotel from earlier!

185
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,110
Damn it!

186
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,550
That's the Baopuzi - Master who Embraces Simplicity.

187
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:18,510
It's a magic book of eternal life from the Sinosphere on becoming an immortal.

188
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,250
Written in it is Chinese alchemy with instructions for the reader to make medicine to cure any disease or curse.

189
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,300
I thought I would be able to do anything if I became a Magician.

190
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,760
I vowed to become a Magician because I didn't want to give up against a curse.

191
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,550
At least not for this stuff.

192
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,910
There was a woman nearly dead from some sort of curse.

193
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,400
With death approaching right behind her, the only thing she could do was smile.

194
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,710
She was a powerless, boring person.

195
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,070
Being unable to save such a boring person,

196
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,510
I cannot talk{there is no talking} about being able to do anything or not wanting to give up...

197
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:19,640
I cannot ruin the precious dream I've always had for such a boring woman.{For such a boring woman I cannot ruin the(can't hurt my) precious dream I've always had.}

198
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,400
Surely{It's surely} not for that boring woman.

199
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,690
Definitely not{It's never} for the sake of that boring woman!

200
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,570
You're wrong!

201
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,570
I understand.{see what's wrong.}

202
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:44,620
Your Azusa bow's power is amplified so much that your mind is flowing back into mine.

203
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:46,590
That's why I understand.

204
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,460
Simply because you love that woman{You only loved that woman.}

205
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:54,000
is why you want to save her even at the cost of{even if it cost you} your life.

206
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,470
You had to hurt others and commit crimes in your bid to save her

207
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,480
since you didn't want that woman to bear any responsibility.{throw that reponsibilty to that woman.}

208
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,560
Which is why you must not taint yourself!

209
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,650
You cannot choose such a method that relies on these half-tainted magic books!

210
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:17,280
Touma!

211
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,370
Touma!

212
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,530
Geez you made me worry.{you caused so much worrying.}

213
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,300
Touma, I'm hungry!

214
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,430
Okay, I'll let you have all the water you can drink.

215
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,550
Hey, Touma!

216
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,890
Am I mistaken?

217
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,470
Am I mistaken to feel the need to protect someone even if it cost me my life?!

218
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,610
Of course you are!

219
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,720
You already know!

220
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,750
The pain of having someone precious die in front of you.

221
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,560
Having someone being hurt and in agony right before you...{in front of you be hurt and feel agony...}

222
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,860
Yet you being unable to do anything for them...

223
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:18,260
You know the pain of being powerless...

224
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,480
You must have felt time was running out, the weight of the burden.

225
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,370
You must have felt distress.

226
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,630
You must have felt anguish.

227
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,810
You must have felt fear.

228
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,680
You must have been shaking.

229
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,540
You must have shouted out loud.

230
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,940
You must have shed tears.

231
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,270
Then what you're doing is wrong!

232
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,230
You cannot let anyone carry such a burden!{shock!/suffering?}

233
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,090
Geez.

234
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,580
I'm in this state after just reading one volume... {Just reading one volume left me in this state.}

235
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:03,550
Look, it was impossible to take in even one original copy in such a small vessel like me.

236
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,900
My life consists only of failures.

237
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:12,370
I have already given up on life three times.

238
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,580
But still...

239
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:20,620
Only one thing I couldn't give up... just that one thing...

240
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,080
But even so...

241
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,520
Ouch!

242
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,050
I won't let you have such a peaceful death{nice boat ending}. {I won't let you finish off neatly like that alone.}{NO YOU NOOO WHERES MY NICEBOAT NICE BOATO NAISU BOOOAAATTTOOO check your anus it's there}

243
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,020
Ouch!

244
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,750
That's for ruining my summer homework.

245
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,740
Geez.

246
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,890
Thanks to you it's impossible for me to finish my homework.

247
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,250
So?

248
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,830
Where is that important person of yours?

249
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,730
What?

250
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,440
I mean, you don't need to use the Index of Forbidden Books to do something about it.

251
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,630
You've seen what my right hand can do, right?

252
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,160
I am no magician, so I don't know what curses are like.

253
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,160
But with this, I can probably erase some curse with a touch.

254
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,970
No way...

255
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,940
I don't understand it well myself, but that's how my right hand works.

256
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,980
So...

257
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,850
Bring me to her.

258
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,640
I will surely save that important person of yours.

259
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,810
But to do that I'll need your cooperation.

260
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,990
So I will have you help me no matter what.

261
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:45,530
You want to save her with your own power too, right?

262
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,250
Geez.

263
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,860
Magic and curses and all that stuff...

264
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,160
Getting thrown around the place with that weird stuff...

265
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,840
Now let's set off to break all those stupid illusions.

266
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,430
Text on fan: "Imouto"

267
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:23,990
Do you know who you've just attacked...?

268
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,190
Geez.

269
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,150
The Knights that England is so proud of are in this state.

270
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:34,480
Did you come to stop me?

271
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,860
I've not been told to stop you as an individual.

272
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,180
And I have my work too.

273
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,040
Where did the order come from, the Anglican Church or the Academy City?

274
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,120
Who knows?

275
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,760
Well it should be easy to figure out if you use some common sense.

276
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,810
Rather, you would figure it out easily if you take into account which side I'm spying for.

277
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,060
I am going now.

278
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,720
Feel free to report to your superiors.

279
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,900
Fine.

280
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,620
Oh yeah, I'll put them away.

281
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,860
Thank you.

282
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:16,570
And so, why did you need to take this long journey from England?

283
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:20,330
Who knows?

A huge plot is taking place outside of the Academy City...

288
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,880
What is the true purpose of the syndicate targeting Orsola Aquinas?
