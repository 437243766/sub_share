1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,730
What is the emergency patient's condition?

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,630
She {hasn't regained conciousness yet.}still remains unconscious.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:06,140
Was it heat stroke after all?

4
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,660
Heat stroke...?

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,740
Oh, so I collapsed and...

6
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:14,200
But why?

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,150
I was taking in fluids...

8
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,020
I also got enough sleep{got proper sleep}.

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,410
{What a fool I am.}I'm such a fool.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,480
Fukiyose, are you all right?

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,970
Fukiyose!

12
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,640
{Will he keep having with}Is he going to keep{continue} showing this expression{like that from now}?

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,780
I don't want that.

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,960
I was working hard, so that{to have} everyone could enjoy themselves.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,190
Will I be alright?

16
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,640
Just who do you think I am?

17
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,420
<b>Shorthand</b>

18
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,690
I'm in this state just because I lost some of my specialties.

19
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,960
Kami-yan has destroyed Oriana's Shorthand.

20
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,120
Has something changed with your condition?

21
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,870
I'm{can use it} fine.

22
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,720
{Seems like there's nothing}Doesn't seem like there's anything wrong anymore.

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,280
I see.

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,780
Then please perform the search spell of the Rihashijin.

25
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,790
I have already prepared it for you.

26
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,220
You do know how to use it, right?

27
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,120
Don't underestimate me.

28
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,350
Is it okay on your side?

29
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,470
If I remember correctly, Oriana's counterattack spell was within the stadium.

30
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,350
No problem.

31
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,100
But a student fell victim to it.

32
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,020
We left in the confusion that happened as a result.

33
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,810
I see.

34
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,680
Is Kamijou Touma furious{enraged}?

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,400
If you're able to figure that out, then please do your job.

36
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,110
Otherwise, we can't be sorry enough to the student who collapsed.

37
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,430
No one is complete.

38
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,160
That's why they regret their own incompleteness, huh?

39
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,840
I wasn't expecting this outcome.

40
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,180
I've confirmed Oriana Thomson's location.

41
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,270
In the 7th Academy District, near the Futsuka subway station.

42
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,220
Kami-yan, it's Futsuka station!

43
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,610
Futsuka station?

44
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,730
We've already passed that!

45
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,960
She's moving north.

46
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,330
The street splits into three, but...

47
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,200
It came up now.

48
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,560
All right, you'll see in front-

49
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,630
Found her!

50
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:46,630
Damn it!

51
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,590
A bus!

52
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,090
Damn it!

53
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,980
Hey Kami-yan, did that bus have any passengers other than Oriana?

54
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,820
That doesn't matter!

55
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,610
Kami-yan!

56
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,430
There weren't any!

57
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,570
No passengers, not even a driver!

58
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,590
Then no worries.

59
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,570
Stiyl, it's bus 5144-57.

60
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,430
{There were still runes that Stiyl put at the service depot left on it.}Stiyl left some runes on it back at the service depot.{There were runes still left on it that Stiyl had put on it at the service depot.}

61
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,020
{Fire won't burn me} Fire doesn't make me hot.{mmm Asobi}

62
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,910
That being said,

63
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,270
I was in such a hurry that I got {it }a little wet down there. {this makes me wet?}

64
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,850
Wanna have a peek?

65
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,780
It's dripping wet right down to my underwear.

66
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,510
Thanks to that spell you set up, an innocent bystander{person that's completely innocent} collapsed!

67
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,510
Did it look like she had anything to do with magic?

68
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,100
There's no one who's unrelated.

69
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,420
People can have relationships with anyone if they feel like it.

70
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,610
So you do understand.

71
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,930
I honestly didn't mean{have any intentions} to hurt her.

72
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,410
Unlike this.

73
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,140
Tsuchimikado!

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,080
Oh my.

75
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,020
It wasn't you who was hurt.

76
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,520
It looks like the Academy City gathers up really rare kids.

77
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,740
What did you do to Tsuchimikado!?

78
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,050
I just cancelled the scarlet properties that are a symbol of rebirth and recovery with blue writing.

79
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,040
{It's a spell that makes those with greater injuries than a certain threshold become unconscious.}It's a spell that knocks people unconscious when their injuries pass a certain threshold.

80
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,050
Tsuchimikado!

81
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,480
Damn it!

82
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,800
I have to destroy that card!

83
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,720
If you want to save him, then you must beat me as fast as you can.

84
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,560
But will he last long enough?

85
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,980
He won't{might not} last too long, you know?

86
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,730
Why you...

87
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,110
I don't give a damn about the worth of some Stab Sword.

88
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,050
Nor do I care about how much it could change history.

89
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,520
I don't know how it can move the world.

90
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,040
But...

91
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,760
It's wrong for someone to get hurt for something that stupid!

92
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,500
If it's a tool that only gives birth to such needless results,

93
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,010
I will shatter and destroy it with my own hands!

94
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,370
It's my work, so it can't be helped.

95
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,510
That being said, your comment would be disrespectful towards my client.

96
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:41,140
Since I have full authority over my methods...

97
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,140
Quit messing with people's lives!

98
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,620
Where?

99
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,470
Crap!

100
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,310
If she uses that spell again...

101
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,730
Next comes a blade of shadows.

102
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,400
I won't allow you to get bored.

103
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,510
Why doesn't she use the same attack?

104
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:23,390
I have no interest in using the same spell I've used already.

105
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,960
{What a failure you are.}You're such a failure.

106
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,570
That was just the foreplay.{before sex play}{lol}

107
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:42,490
You're worn out already?

108
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,450
Damn it!

109
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,490
Even though she isn't using the same magic she's used before...

110
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,270
How does she have such a huge inventory of combinations?

111
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,440
Next is Blade Crete.{not sure}

112
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,870
Hey you.

113
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,030
Move from that position and you die.

114
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,830
Move, and I die?

115
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,370
Why should I care about that?

116
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,390
The Daihaseisai that Fukiyose has been working so hard up till this day to prepare,

117
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,510
is about to become a mess!

118
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,690
You thought I could leave it like this?

119
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,820
Of course you wouldn't be satisfied with that!

120
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,340
Kamijou Touma?

121
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,660
T-This idiot!

122
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,770
That right hand...

123
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,140
Even to that extent?

124
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,900
Then...

125
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,120
Drop Left!{wat}{saa...}

126
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,200
Tsuchimikado!   {TESUOOOO!!!}

127
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,980
Are you all right?

128
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,230
Tsuchimikado?

129
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,930
You play way too rough.

130
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,890
Look, my buttons came off.

131
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,250
That was a good{well done} punch, for a beginner.

132
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,520
I guess{I should say}.

133
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:18,440
However, being used to having attacks being read and getting counter attacked,

134
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,110
I would still consider your level as unsatisfactory.{it causing even more unsatisfication}.

135
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,530
Well for now, I leave that to your side.

136
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,350
Don't think the game is over here.

137
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:40,070
It's going to heat up from now on.

138
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,860
Wait!

139
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,630
What about Tsuchimikado?

140
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,080
The effect of the spell only lasts for 20 minutes.

141
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,260
It'll wear off soon.

142
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,760
Dear worrywart ability user.

143
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,410
All right.

144
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:59,980
Then destroy the Stab Sword.

145
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,250
It shouldn't be {possible without any}a problem using your right hand.

146
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,440
But is it okay for me to destroy it?

147
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,540
They might go on attacking people in the Academy City...

148
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,210
It would be them who would be captured if they do so.

149
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,800
This is the Academy City.

150
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,620
For the people on the magic side, it's in the middle of enemy territory.

151
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,650
They will retreat at once and take some time to think of countermeasures.

152
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,540
I got it.

153
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,340
Hurry up.

154
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,820
I will discuss our future course of action with my superiors.

155
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,080
I got it.

156
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,390
Well then...

157
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,540
What is this?

158
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,600
What the hell is this?

159
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,340
Well, though a lot of things happened...

160
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,240
Since I've gone through all the required checkpoints,

161
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,280
{you don't need to feel worried.}there's no need for you to worry.

162
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,310
What do you mean by a lot of things?

163
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:06,250
Well, leave it to me.

164
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,040
Oh right.

165
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,720
Since they've taken the sign away,

166
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,190
They should have already figured out about the Stab Sword by now as well.

167
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,890
Oh?

168
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,570
It's okay.

169
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,020
Since it's not a situation{in a condition} that would change the outcome of the transaction anyway{the transaction's outcome would change or anything}.

170
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,940
I wouldn't let anyone get in the way{bother it}.

171
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,980
And no one would be able to do so.

172
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,120
If everyone will be happy from this transaction, then that's all the more reason for it{even more surely}.

173
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,330
There isn't an original of the Stab Sword.

174
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:44,380
Only people's speculations have formed such a lasting legend.

175
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,090
Oh, really?

176
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,450
Is what's written here the truth?

177
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,120
Charles Conder?

178
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,340
We're very sorry.

179
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,190
We here at the British Museum didn't figure this out until this very day.

180
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,660
Then, what do you say that is?

181
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,000
Well yes...

182
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,350
Since the legends are snowballing and transforming, we have no definite conclusion, but...

183
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,470
This is no sword.

184
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,070
Then what?

185
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,410
In the origin, they call it the Croce di Pietro.

186
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,590
In our words here, it seems it would have been called St. Peter's Cross{the Cross of St. Peter}.

187
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,160
St. Peter's Cross{The Cross of St. Peter}?

188
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:31,650
Then the meaning of the transaction they are doing has changed from the original one{very start}.

189
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,900
With the end of the transaction, the Academy City will collapse.

190
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,850
No, something greater than that would happen.

191
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:43,920
Geez.

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,060
{What absurdity that is.}That's absurd!

193
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,660
So this means the item is dangerous after all?

194
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,760
Croce di Pietro,

195
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,340
something that could be considered St. Peter's Cross.

196
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,610
The Episcopal See {Apostolic See}of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican, started ages ago

197
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,380
when St. Peter's body was buried in a great body of land and a cross was placed there.

198
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,650
You could also put it the other way too.

199
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,290
The other way?

200
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:13,780
The land the Croce di Pietro was thrust into would without choice become under the control of the Roman Catholic Church.

201
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,770
Even if it were the Academy City.

202
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:16,760
Control?!

203
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,660
Everything would happen in the direction that the Roman Catholics would favor.

204
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,690
And no one would find anything strange with that change, and accept it.

205
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,080
Regardless of how unreasonable the requests may be{given to them are},

206
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,360
or regardless of how outrageous a burden it may create{they will be given},

207
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,810
a world where people would only feel happiness would be born.

208
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,650
No way...

209
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:41,490
If the Academy City conveniently falls into the hands of the Roman Catholics,

210
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:47,210
the world that's now in balance with one half as the Science side and the other as the Magic side,

211
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,430
would become completely dominated by a single Roman Catholic Church.

212
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,390
Then by transaction you mean...

213
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,500
Yes.

214
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,180
It's both the Academy City as a whole, and the right to rule the world.

215
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,540
We will stop this transaction.

216
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:16,220
Otherwise, the world would face a reality far worse than just a collapse.

217
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,620
Touma!

218
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,440
A world where everyone would only feel happiness...

219
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,010
Touma!
A world where everyone would only feel happiness...

220
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,610
Touma!

221
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,630
I don't really understand after thinking about it.

222
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,590
Touma!

223
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:44,950
Huh?

224
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,350
No, there's no way Index would be wearing clothes like that.

225
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,510
Touma!

226
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,690
Why won't you look me in the eyes?

227
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,890
That aside, why are you dressed like that?

228
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,060
Come to think of it...

229
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:06,700
Touma, Touma,

230
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,090
You're trying to recall some lewd scene.

231
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,750
I seem to notice that Touma has a very happy expression.

232
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,330
I don't!

233
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,440
I really don't at all!

234
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,550
Actually, what happened to your usual sister outfit?

235
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,760
I had Komoe hold onto it.

236
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,550
Umm...

237
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,670
What are you so angry about?

238
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,610
Oh, I got it!

239
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,770
You're hungry, aren't you?

240
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,160
We will get together with father and mother and have lunch.

241
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,170
You only need to wait a little longer-

242
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,100
Umm... Index-san?

243
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,190
Ouch!

244
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,320
It's not like that!

245
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,550
You idiot, Touma!

246
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,620
Then what?

247
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,170
I changed into these so that I can cheer for Touma.

248
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,500
Where were you while I was doing that?

249
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,420
Uhh well...

250
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,920
I worked hard thinking that I could be with Touma.

251
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,640
What should I do if you were to go off somewhere on your own?

252
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,360
I'm so sorry.

253
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,520
I thought you were hungry and angry as usual.

254
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,020
Hey, that's not so!

255
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,590
Ouch, ouch!
Hey, that's not so!

256
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,090
I'm angry because it seems like you don't care about me!{Imma cockblock yer ass for life for giving so little shit about me}
Ouch, ouch!

257
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,490
Ouch, ouch!
I'm angry because it seems like you don't care about me!{Imma cockblock yer ass for life for giving so little shit about me}

258
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,720
As you said, I'm angry from being hungry, but that's an emotion that I'm unrelated to, considering that I'm a sister, Touma!

259
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,350
Index! What happened to your usual biting?
As you said, I'm angry from being hungry, but that's an emotion that I'm unrelated to, considering that I'm a sister, Touma!

260
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,590
Oh no, you really don't have to force yourself to do it.
As you said, I'm angry from being hungry, but that's an emotion that I'm unrelated to, considering that I'm a sister, Touma!

261
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,250
Oh no, you really don't have to force yourself to do it.

262
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,490
Huh?

263
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,440
Touma, you pervert!

264
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,000
Wha- it was you who was always biting me.

265
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,270
You're the one who's actually perverted!

266
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,410
Ouch!

267
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,390
I think we won't be able to find Touma-san for a while.

268
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,800
Well, they have this many people.

269
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,620
We may not be able to find him after all.

270
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,550
Oh!

271
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,680
Hello!

272
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,320
We meet again.

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,330
Oh, you're the one from this morning.

274
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,760
Thank you for this morning.

275
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,360
Thanks to that, see?

276
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,750
Who are they?

277
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,290
Do you know them?

278
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:20,670
It's the parents of that boy you care so much about.

279
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:24,770
Nice to meet you, I'm Kamijou.

280
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:26,110
Hello.

281
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,490
Umm, I'm...

282
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,470
Come on, show some appeal.

283
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,800
I-It's not like that!

284
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,840
What are you saying!?

285
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,090
Oh, by the way, have you had lunch yet?

286
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,560
No, not yet.

287
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:40,560
If it's fine with you, would you care to join us?

288
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,890
We have a great place.

289
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,320
Really?

290
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,910
We would be grateful for that.

291
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,290
Oh, are you all right?

292
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,500
Oh no, I'm sorry.

293
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,410
I'm just not used to crowded places like this.

294
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:57,330
I-I wasn't paying enough attention either.

295
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,340
Well then, I shall be leaving.

296
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,910
Y-yes.

297
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,410
My, my. {ara ara}

298
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,590
Touya-san, again you're...

299
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:07,190
No, it's not like that!

300
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:09,210
I wasn't hooked by her or anything! {liar}

301
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,060
So you see, it's like...

302
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,090
I'm sorry!

303
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,600
They're indeed father and son.{So they are father and so after all.}{or maybe Like father like son lol}

304
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,910
Yo, Touma!

305
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,400
Over here!

306
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,330
Come here!

307
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,840
How did you find a place like this?

308
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,180
Well, this person over here told us.

309
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,130
I'm Misaka.

310
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,790
I see.

311
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,590
Thank you so much.

312
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,870
Phew, I'm really hungry.

313
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,740
Hey, you.

314
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,830
Why are you always with this search result = zero treatment for {condition about }me?

315
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,290
Well, I thought things would just naturally turn out like this.

316
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:48,500
Like hell they would!

317
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,500
There's no such thing as a natural outcome with you around!

318
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:58,380
For starters, who is this girl that is always at your side{sticking right by you} all time, and where does she live?{please check}

319
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,220
Who? Well that's...

320
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,380
That's right, Touma.

321
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,200
Come to think of it, who is that girl?

322
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,170
She came along when we had that sleepover trip at the beach too.

323
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,510
The beach?!

324
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,030
A sleepover at the beach?!

325
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:16,180
And who's this short haired girl that's asking? Where does she even live?{And says the who living in where, short hair?}{lol wut?}

326
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,530
Are you Touma's girlfriend or something?

327
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,660
No, I'm just...

328
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,140
You came to cheer for Touma's school as well?

329
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,830
If I remember correctly...

330
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,230
It was during stick toppling.

331
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,170
It's not!

332
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,130
Hey!

333
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,130
You shut up!

334
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,410
My, my.

335
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,260
We should have lunch now.

336
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,100
Umm...

337
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,470
You are Kamijou Touma-kun, right?

338
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,260
That's right, but...

339
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,550
Umm... are you Misaka's older sister or something?

340
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,310
Oh no.

341
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,660
I'm Misaka Misuzu.

342
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,300
Mikoto's mother.{I approve of this MILF}{She must be fine!! I gotta catch up} {woah milfing tiem}

343
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,310
