1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
{OP}

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
{Move Point}

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
{intermission}

4
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,700
Misaka Mikoto's daily life that should have had its peace restored

5
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,420
was being obscured by a dark cloud once again.

6
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,510
The mysterious organisation that was moving for the remains of Tree Diagram...

7
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,450
Musujime Awaki who is a level 4 ability user with the skill, Move Point...

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:19,490
and Shirai Kuroko who caught a glimpse of Misaka's solitary battle, unbeknownst to anyone...

9
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,420
<b>Move Point</b>

10
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,560
What is this?

11
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,800
She was lying that there were commoners!

12
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,490
She must have taken me lightly and assumed I would not teleport myself.

13
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,670
I can always do so, if I feel motivated enough...

14
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:36,960
If I am motivated... not even traumatic experiences...

15
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,100
Are not easily overcome.

16
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,270
There's a reason why its called a "traumatic experience."

17
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,190
Two years ago, you teleported yourself and got gravely hurt.

18
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,450
I suppose you miscalculated the coordinates and got yourself stuck in a wall or something.

19
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,900
Oh, how lame.

20
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,410
Don't be so hasty.

21
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,790
I've avoided your vitals so far.

22
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,590
Well, I only hit you at the spots where you hit me earlier.

23
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,340
Use this to stop your bleeding.

24
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,550
It works quite well, you know?

25
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,310
Why don't you tumble on the ground and treat your wounds?

26
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,350
We'll finally be on equal terms after you do it.

27
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,820
Hmm?

28
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,820
You really must be an ardent admirer of that Ace of Tokiwadai.

29
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,020
But is she worth you defending her so much?

30
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,570
That selfish, sentimental, and fairy-tale like world that the Railgun dreams of...

31
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,360
No doubt, I want to protect it.

32
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,250
Regardless of how selfish it may be,

33
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,330
Onee-sama desires it.

34
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,460
A situation where you and I do not have to do this kind of stuff anymore.

35
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:03,220
If she's motivated enough, she can crush everything with a single coin.

36
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,640
But she's the kind of person who can still say

37
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,600
with a serious face that she doesn't want us to be fighting even in the most helpless of situations.

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,060
Did you ever think I would ignore that will of hers?

39
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,000
I will now send you back to live an ordinary life.

40
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,990
Just like what someone somewhere dreamt of, whom I sympathize with...

41
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:27,200
Then, if I trample over that will,

42
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,780
I suppose it's my victory.

43
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,800
The same tactic will never work-

44
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,400
I can't teleport...

45
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,130
What's wrong?

46
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,130
You can't use teleport anymore because of the pain?

47
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,380
Hey, do you know of a story like this?

48
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,600
Long ago, in a certain place, there lived a very strong ability user and there was an organisation.

49
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,940
The organisation thought that they could obtain enormous power...

50
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,780
if they increased the number of that specific ability user, so they constructed many clones.

51
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,130
However, the outcome was horrible.

52
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:57,120
The helpless sheep constructed were disappointing, defective products with less than 1% of the original's abilities.

53
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,040
"Why don't we sort out the information we have gathered up to now?"

54
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,630
Misaka No. 10032 suggests through the network to the unknown large number of individual units out there.

55
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,560
"Currently, the only remnant that would allow restoration of the Tree Diagram is in the Academy City."

56
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,980
"The name of the external organisation going after it is the Science Syndicate."

57
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,940
"Is everything correct with that?"

58
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,900
Misaka No. 10032 confirms again.

59
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,160
"That is correct."

60
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,370
Misaka No. 10045 reaffirms.

61
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:40,580
"But No. 10032, out of all the units, you have received particularly severe physical damage."

62
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,630
"Isn't it recommended that you concentrate on recovery?"

63
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:47,210
Misaka No. 10744 shows her concern.

64
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,310
"There's no need to worry."

65
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,720
Misaka No. 10032 quickly responds.

66
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,280
"The restoration of the Tree Diagram must be stopped at all costs."

67
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:08,320
Misaka No. 10032 recalls the faces of that boy and girl and so reiterates its determination.

68
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,320
"We understand."

69
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,740
"We all trust in you."

70
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,960
Misaka No. 14458 nods sagely. {do not edit or remove or i rage.}

71
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,910
"Please do your best."

72
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,710
Misaka No. 19002 fully agrees.

73
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,830
Misaka wishes for it too!

74
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,080
Misaka of Misaka tries asking.

75
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,220
Rather, Misaka wants to do something too!

76
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,050
Staying quiet all alone is...

77
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,140
Misaka of Misaka thinks-

78
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,920
Hey!

79
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,640
You're noisy.

80
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,770
What have you been muttering about?

81
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,510
Oh?

82
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,020
It's nothing.

83
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,350
Misaka of Misaka tries to close its mouth.

84
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,860
I see.

85
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,440
Hey, Shirai-san,

86
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,450
even being exactly the same as the original genetically and receiving the same ability development program,

87
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:03,080
why can't the clones achieve the same level as the original?

88
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:09,220
Could it be that there's another factor besides the brain structure that affects this?

89
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,920
If we can figure that out, doesn't that mean beings other than humans will be able to use abilities?

90
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,060
Organisms with equal or superior brains to humans...

91
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,270
They might be there, somewhere closer than you've imagined.

92
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,140
What are you talking about?

93
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,200
You can't possibly mean that abilities will reside in machines...

94
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,650
Machines are only machines.

95
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,700
But they can predict outcomes.

96
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,950
If there is an ultimate simulation machine that can recreate any kind of phenomena,

97
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,160
I'll ask it for all possibilities,

98
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:46,250
of whether organisms exist that can use supernatural abilities instead of humans.

99
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,840
For example, dolphins are called the humans of the sea.{by Sea Shepherd}

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,230
The ant society has strong law and order.

101
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,350
Supernatural ability shouldn't be a trait exclusive to humans.

102
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,470
So are abilities limited only to human beings?

103
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,160
I... want to figure that out.

104
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,960
To do so, I will build a new tree diagram out of this Remnant!

105
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,210
Ouch!

106
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,700
How did this happen so suddenly?!

107
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,370
Hey, get off me!

108
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,160
No, I'm sorry! Please get off me, Index-san!

109
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,170
That was cruel, Touma.

110
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,870
Huh?

111
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,220
I put in so much effort to make such a wonderful tongue-twister.

112
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,680
You know...

113
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,550
<i>Touma ga tooku de toofu wo toome ni mite tonma </i> - it's a tongue twister
Touma is an idiot, looking far sightedly at tofu, from afar.

114
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,980
There's no doubt that you're making fun of me!

115
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,400
What?

116
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,430
Uhh... I was lying...

117
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,390
Huh?

118
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,450
Misaka?

119
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,860
"We request a favour from you."

120
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,430
Misaka looks straight into your eyes, and bares all its heart.

121
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:09,130
"Please save Misaka and our sisters' lives."

122
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,330
I won't let them!

123
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,680
That experiment...

124
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,180
I will never allow them to restart it!

125
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,110
Anti-skill Operations Headquarters

126
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,070
A property damage case which resulted from presumably a clash between ability users at a restaurant in Area F...

127
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,900
That idiot!

128
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,240
I was searching for you, Biribiri!{Sparky!}

129
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,960
Searching... Why...?

130
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,880
Why are you here again?

131
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Hey,

132
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,260
Let's go, Biribiri.

133
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,890
If you bought this you were ripped off.

134
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,690
You teamed up with an external organisation for that?

135
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,870
Yes.

136
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:21,880
Even if I were to obtain a valuable Remnant, I can't recover them all alone.

137
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:27,540
So I needed a group with the technology, knowledge and intent.

138
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:30,370
Shirai-san, how did you feel?

139
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,880
The very first moment that you obtained your ability.

140
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,890
Honestly, I was terrified.

141
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,710
I was horrified more than anything that I had such an ability within myself.

142
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,590
If the recipient doesn't have to be human or me, then why do I have this ability?

143
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:54,580
The people I was with had the exact same issue as me.

144
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,110
They all cursed their own ability and were continuously searching for an answer.

145
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,290
That's why they willingly cooperated and didn't object to even become a shield.

146
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,660
Don't you also have these experiences too?

147
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,780
When you hurt someone using your own ability.

148
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,040
I understand how you feel...

149
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,430
Since you and I are very similar...

150
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,590
How do you feel, Shirai-san?

151
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:20,880
If you have the intention to find out the truth together,

152
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,590
I will gladly invite you.

153
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,900
No, thank you.

154
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,190
You thought you could convince me, Shirai Kuroko, with something as self-serving as that?

155
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,770
Nothing less from someone as evil as you.

156
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,650
You speak only of trivial matters.

157
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:39,900
Why don't you understand?

158
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:44,240
We could have become something other than these monsters called Ability Users.

159
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,070
Such a dangerous ability-

160
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,980
You're a fool.

161
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,370
Abilities are only abilities, no matter how much you think about it.

162
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,290
It's entirely up to you on how you decide to use that power.

163
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,330
Are you an idiot to not be able to recognise such a simple thing?

164
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,520
You're afraid of the ability?

165
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,250
You don't want it because it hurts others?

166
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,590
Don't make me laugh.

167
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,720
It doesn't matter if you possess an ability,

168
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,030
it won't change the fact that you're the type of person who hurts others!{LOL}

169
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:18,940
Ultimately, all that you were saying can be simply summarised that you're special and the people around you are ordinary.

170
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,520
It's just an ideology of escapism and a despicable mentality!

171
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:29,320
I'll now teach your rotten spirit a lesson!

172
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,570
No...

173
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,370
No...

174
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,530
Don't come!

175
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
I will kill you.

176
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,450
Thank you so much for breaking me.

177
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,070
If only you didn't exist,

178
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:54,070
I would have been able to do anything!

179
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,460
My maximum load for Move Point is 4,520 kg.

180
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,060
I can slam it here from afar.

181
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,040
Not only you, but this whole building would topple.

182
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,760
Oh, you still needed that case?

183
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,980
I will destroy you...

184
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,440
Since you destroyed me!

185
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,730
I will get you back for that!

186
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,490
Onee-sama...

187
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,930
4,520 kg...

188
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,660
This light is...

189
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,100
Onee-sama!

190
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,140
You mustn't come!

191
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,030
Kuroko!

192
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,940
You are...

193
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,590
This is A001 to M000,

194
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,460
after checking our codes, I want to report the situation.

195
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:18,010
Manipulating children and watching from a safe seat in the audience?

196
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,720
What a great position you are in.

197
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:26,470
What should I...

198
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,600
What should I do?{get hit by a car?}

199
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,750
I'm sure you know...

200
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,610
I got out after going through quite a hassle.

201
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:49,370
And what do I see? Some needless looking loser.{Needless anyone?}

202
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,500
No way...

203
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,470
The Accelarator?

204
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,470
The strongest Level 5 in the Academy City that even the Railgun is no match for?

205
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,880
It's impossible!

206
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,600
There's no way I can seriously go against something like that!

207
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,020
I know!

208
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,600
Huh?

209
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,450
On August 31st, you should have lost your ability!

210
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,070
Right...

211
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,170
You don't have any processing ability that you had before!

212
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:23,530
You don't have any of the former power you used to possess!

213
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,420
Pathetic.

214
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,750
If you actually believe that, you're so pitiful that you deserve a hug.

215
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,590
It's true I received damage to my brain on that day.

216
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,510
Now I have the processing done externally.

217
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,850
But you see,

218
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:47,970
just because I'm weaker doesn't make you stronger, does it?

219
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,660
Sorry.

220
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,030
There's only one way to proceed from here onwards.

221
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:16,620
Quietly cuddle up, tremble in fear and go back to your former nest!

222
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,720
Well...

223
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,110
With the state I'm in now, I might have to consider retiring as the strongest in the Academy City.

224
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,070
But still, I...

225
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,580
I've decided to claim myself as the strongest in front of that kid.

226
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,330
Shit-holes.

227
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,130
Look, Touma!

228
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,350
I finally mastered the way to buy drinks!

229
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,210
Right...

230
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,850
What's wrong, Touma?

231
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,880
Don't ask me what's wrong!

232
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,640
Huh?

233
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:08,930
Ah...

234
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,970
I came to visit Shirai in the hospital and...

235
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,860
Without much of a choice, I went to Misaka-imouto's place and then...

236
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,070
What misfortune.

237
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,950
And?

238
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,240
{What are Remnants, in the end?}Anyways, what are Remnants?

239
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,830
You left guns blazing with that girl who's now naked but produced no results?

240
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:33,880
Right.

241
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,960
The female suspect was already beaten up by someone.

242
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,200
The contents of the case were shattered as well.

243
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:42,970
Seriously, who in the world did that?

244
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:48,020
So I heard that Yomikawa destroyed the Science Syndicate outside.

245
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,970
It seems they were in contact with Amai Ao too.

246
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,940
Misaka of Misaka reports.

247
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,520
Oh, really.

248
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,980
Hey, what is with that unserious, ignorant attitude?!

249
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,070
Misaka of Misaka-

250
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,440
Shut up.

251
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,530
Show some gratitude in the form of silence.

252
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,830
The weather forecast wasn't right after all.

253
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,630
You're right.

254
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,960
Onee-sama.

255
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,340
I realised... That place was the world you were fighting in.

256
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,460
Kuroko...

257
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,890
All of this was caused because I wasn't good enough.

258
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,140
So Onee-sama, please continue smiling.

259
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,190
Kuroko will have that smile to use as fuel{motivation} to stand up again.

260
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,980
Okay.

261
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,200
Thank you, Kuroko.

A new magician that sneaks in uses that chance...

266
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,930
What is her purpose?
