00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:05,850
Archbishop... {marsd note: originals in braces and we use BrE}

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,150
I have told you before not to address me in that manner. {I've told you already. You mustn't call me by that, all right?}

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:14,030
Why did we come all the way out here without bodyguards

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:16,890
just to talk when we could have done it in St. George's Cathedral? {weird line aistad yoroshiku ne}

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,180
I can't stay cooped up in that old place every day. {I can't keep myself stuffed in that old place every day.}

6
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:26,020
We can talk while walking too.

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,140
Well, it's fine either way.{it's fine though...}

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,660
You're quite the narrow-minded person, Steyr.{not have much understanding/generosity}{small is funny because of his (large dick?) tall height}

9
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:36,750
Can't you enjoy the moment of sharing this walk with me?{ moment you are sharing with me on this walk? - awkward phrasing - plz note}

10
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,400
Laura Stewart,{from king of scots}

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,970
may I make just one comment?

12
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,670
You speak really formally.

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,470
What is it?

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,490
Why are you speaking in such a silly{stupid} manner?

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,480
Wha-

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,780
Is it weird?!

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,190
I got an actual Japanese person to check my speech too! {lol weird}

18
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,910
And who would that be?{Who was it, that you asked?}

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,040
That... Tsuchimikado Motoharu.

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,610
Please don't use him as the standard for normal Japanese people.{an example of a standard Japanese person.}

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,230
An amulet for communication...?

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,560
Have you heard of the Book of Law, "Liber AL vel Legis?"{the book of the law}

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,790
A magical book?{name of a magic book?}

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,100
If I remember correctly, the author was...

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,550
Edward Alexander.

26
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,600
The original was kept in the Roman Catholic's Vatican Library. {Vatican Library of the Roman Catholics.}

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,750
But it can't be deciphered anymore.{by anyone.}

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:37,200
Even the Index of Prohibited Books who has 103,000 books memorized couldn't do it.{ Liborvm Prohibitorvm }

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:42,690
What if someone who could decipher the "Liber AL vel Legis" were to appear?

30
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,790
What did you say?!

31
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,860
That person is a Roman Catholic sister who goes by the name of Orsola Acquinas.

32
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:57,530
So do they intend to use "Liber AL vel Legis" as a weapon in the power struggle?{between these religions}

33
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,870
All's well.{It's all right.}

34
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,960
At least{, as} for now.

35
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,010
Since I heard that both "Liber AL vel Legis" and Orsola Acquinas were "stolen" at the same time.{Since I hear "Liber AL vel Legis" and  Orsola Acquinas, both of them were stolen at the same time.}

36
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,430
Shall we further discuss the details inside?{Let's talk about have the details inside.}

37
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,540
<b>Liber Al vel Legis</b>

38
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,370
The second trimester schedule is packed!{is busy, you know?}
<b>Liber Al vel Legis</b>

39
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,260
The second trimester schedule is packed!{is busy, you know?}

40
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,330
The Combined Sports Meet{Daihaseisai aAthletics Festival, explained later}, the World's Largest Cultural Festival...

41
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,500
Also, the Arts Appreciation Festival and Society Observation Day{ie, field trip} too.

42
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,880
It's packed with festivals.

43
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,830
Are you okay, Sphinx?

44
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,020
But I'm free! I'm bored! Life's dull!

45
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,140
Touma doesn't play with me at all!

46
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,790
Kamijou Touma has his own circumstances{reasons}.

47
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,480
It's not like he's stuck in school because he likes it. {weird}

48
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,710
Why are you not stuck in school then, Maika?{weird cont}

49
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:26,200
I'm an exception to the rule.

50
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,340
Since maid training is typically done in real world settings...

51
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,370
Then I'm going to be a maid too!

52
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,990
And I might go visit Touma's class!

53
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,410
The path to becoming a maid is rough.

54
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,780
It's tough for a girl with zero housekeeping abilities.

55
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,720
Oh, then I'll turn Touma into a maid instead!{Oh then I'm going to make Touma into a maid!}

56
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,560
And then have him visit me!

57
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,330
It's a form of kindness to not tell Touma that, okay? {weirdshit}

58
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,110
Yes, that's right.

59
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,590
I'm sorry, but...

60
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,310
You've run out of time to become a maid.

61
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,990
Same goes for him.{but there's no time, none for you to become a maid, or for him to become one either.}

62
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,890
Combined Sports Meet - Coming Soon

63
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,540
The Combined Sports Meet...
Combined Sports Meet - Coming Soon

64
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:20,560
The Combined Sports Meet...

65
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,030
In which{Where} all the schools in Academy City participate...

66
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,990
The purpose is to observe large scale interference between ability users.

67
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,450
Unlimited use of abilities is recommended only for this day.{On this day only, limitless usage of abilities is recommended, huh?}

68
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,770
I, Kamijou Touma, am still suffering from amnesia for some reason...{is at memory loss due to a certain reason.}

69
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:53,100
So I don't even remember anything about a huge event like that.

70
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,960
Well...

71
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,220
What should we have for dinner?

72
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,140
K-K-K-Kamijou Touma!

73
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:11,760
Huh?

74
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,020
It's an emergency!

75
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,020
The silver-haired sister was abducted by someone!

76
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,700
Huh?

77
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm saying it's a kidnapping! An abduction!

78
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,400
Hang on, what are you talking about?

79
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,590
The kidnapper left this as he was leaving.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,950
Kamijou Touma,

81
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,680
Kamijou Touma, if you value her life, come alone to Hakumeiza, the abandoned theater outside Academy City, at seven tonight.

82
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,790
If you value her life,
Kamijou Touma, if you value her life, come alone to Hakumeiza, the abandoned theater outside Academy City, at seven tonight.

83
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,420
come alone to Hakumeiza, the abandoned theater outside Academy City, at seven tonight.{If you value her life, come to the abandoned theater, Hakumeiza, alone... Outside the Academy City at seven tonight.}
Kamijou Touma, if you value her life, come alone to Hakumeiza, the abandoned theater outside Academy City, at seven tonight.

84
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:46,170
come alone to Hakumeiza, the abandoned theater outside Academy City, at seven tonight.{If you value her life, come to the abandoned theater, Hakumeiza, alone... Outside the Academy City at seven tonight.}

85
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,900
So, what did the bastard look like?

86
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,550
Firstly, he was over 180cm tall...{has a height over 180cm}

87
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:58,350
He had blazing red hair, a bar-code under his right eye...

88
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,750
A cigarette in his mouth and lots of piercings on his ears...

89
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,720
It's ok.{Okay, I got it.}

90
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,290
This "kidnapper" happens to be an acquaintance of Index and I{me and Index}.

91
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,020
So the kidnapper is an acquaintance?

92
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,400
Are you saying this was the result of a love triangle gone bad?

93
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,150
Uhh... I didn't mean...

94
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,800
Huh?

95
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,080
Leave Permit

96
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:21,200
A leave permit?

97
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,170
I hope you have a grasp of the situation now.

98
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:30,550
The "Liber AL vel Legis" has been stolen.

99
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:35,680
And that the only person who can decipher it, Orsola Acquinas, was also kidnapped?

100
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,810
The prime suspect is the Amakusa Catholics.{<- they have random kanji for this "Amakusa Style Amazing Religion of the Cross"}

101
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,980
How did they manage to steal it from the heavily-guarded Vatican Library?

102
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,590
The Roman Catholics were transferring "Liber AL vel Legis" to a Japanese museum.

103
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,800
What tomfoolery.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,910
Shipping something so dangerous...

105
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,450
Did the Roman Catholics request co-operation from the Anglican Church?

106
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,180
No.

107
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,980
More importantly, something worse has occurred.{she speaks in really bad antient speak}

108
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,870
What has?

109
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,460
I can't contact Kanzaki Kaori.

110
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,690
Kanzaki is the former head of the Amakusa.

111
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:20,440
If she finds out that the Amakusa is in conflict with the Roman Catholics...

112
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,920
I would like you to resolve this before she does something silly.

113
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,520
I won't restrict your methods.

114
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,110
Kanzaki is one of fewer than twenty Saints of the world. {the less than 20 Saints in the world.}

115
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:40,730
You can't be asking me to fight her?{Don't tell me you want me to fight against her.}

116
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,600
If the situation arises.{If the situation asks for it, you may.}

117
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,830
You are to make contact with the Academy City.

118
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,480
Steyr, take this with you.

119
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,420
This is...

120
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,610
I consider this a small gift for Orsola.

121
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,810
The Liborvm Prohibitorvm...

122
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,450
We do need expert help, right?

123
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,570
Why did you have to get Touma involved?

124
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,490
I don't know.

125
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,410
Why do I have to summon someone like him...

126
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,480
So, are we going to the Amakusa headquarters?

127
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,870
No, the situation is a little different.

128
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,800
Damn...

129
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:41,800
Where is it...

130
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,150
That 'Hakumeiza' theater...

131
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,100
I don't have a clue about things outside Academy City.

132
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,680
Huh?

133
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,980
A sister?

134
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,780
I hope she's not Index's acquaintance.

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,920
Excuse me...

136
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,910
Umm... What's the matter?

137
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,140
Do I take a bus from here to reach Academy City?{Should I take this bus to arrive at the Academy City? - very polite speak}

138
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,460
Academy City?

139
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,170
No, there are no buses going into Academy City.

140
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,920
Excuse me?

141
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,220
Not only are there no buses, all transportation going in has also been cut off.

142
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,550
There's a gate over there so you can walk right in.

143
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:32,530
Thank you for assisting me even though you're busy.{Thank you for your assistance when you must be so busy.}

144
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,350
I said you can't take the bus!{I'm telling you that you can't take the bus!}

145
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,720
Oh, right.

146
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,530
You did say that. {It wasn't just a mention, he said it explicitly}

147
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,880
I said you have to walk that way and enter through the gates.

148
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,100
Got it?

149
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,580
I'm sorry to have troubled you.

150
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,870
Hey you!

151
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,580
Don't smile then ignore all my explanations!{You're ignoring all my explanations with a smile!}

152
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,590
You seem to be a little annoyed at something.

153
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,740
No, not really...

154
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,890
I'm sorry for being rude, but you are perspiring quite a bit.

155
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,960
Th-Thank you!

156
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,080
By the way, why do you want to go into the Academy City?

157
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,040
Uhh...

158
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,620
Actually, I'm...

159
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,110
Huh?

160
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,950
...being pursued. {not a complete sentence fags will just qq about punctuation again wah wah wah}

161
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,310
Huh? Being pursued?

162
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,500
The situation is a mess!

163
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,120
We are receiving conflicting reports.

164
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,830
We don't even know if "Liber AL vel Legis" is back in our possession.

165
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,420
Oh sorry, I should introduce myself first.

166
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,720
I'm Agnese Sanctis from the Roman Catholic Church.

167
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,580
I see.

168
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,860
And so, what magic does the Amakusa use?

169
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:57,480
Honestly, we've not been able to accurately analyze the magic either.

170
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,580
The most notable aspect of the Amakusa is subtlety.

171
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,480
The Amakusa does not use easily recognizable spells or magic circles.

172
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,570
Since ceremonies and spells are disguised as everyday activities and gestures,

173
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,150
even a professional magician cannot discern an Amakusa's identity.

174
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,650
What troublesome bastards.

175
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,040
Oh, it's Touma!

176
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,610
Orsola Acquinas!

177
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,890
If you bought this you were ripped off.

178
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,890
What the heck is this!

179
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,390
Why are you doing some kidnap-play!

180
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,780
Oh, you knew all along?

181
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,280
Well, I wanted you to help me search for a missing person.{ out with a missing person search.}

182
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,720
Search?

183
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,390
Don't worry about it.

184
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:52,990
If you hand over the sister standing beside you...

185
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,220
Huh?

186
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,200
Like I said...

187
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,580
That sister over there is Orsola Acquinas, the missing person we've been searching for{being looked for}.

188
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,490
Good work, you can go home now.

189
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,820
Uhh...

190
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,720
Why did I have to walk all the way here in this heat?

191
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,300
That's why I told you, "good work."

192
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,560
You want me to treat you to some shaved ice?

193
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:24,210
I've always tried my best to try to befriend you despite our differences...

194
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,590
Yeah, that was until this moment!

195
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:31,030
You want me to care for you?

196
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:36,430
Unfortunately, I can't relieve your loneliness nor do I want to do so.

197
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,740
Hand over Orsola to Agnese.

198
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,350
By the way, you were talking about being pursued...

199
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,070
What's wrong, Orsola?

200
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,340
Oh dear.

201
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,100
I can't have her taken away so easily.

202
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,430
Orsola Acquinas, you can live a more meaningful life

203
00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:01,590
if you come with us, Amakusa, rather than stay with the Roman Catholics.

204
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,480
The Amakusa?!

205
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,500
Orsola!

206
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,210
Don't go, Touma!

207
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,910
In my hands, let there be fire.

208
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:16,090
Take the shape of a sword!

209
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,700
Your purpose-

210
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,410
It looks like we were too late.

211
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,790
Hey, Steyr.

212
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:30,640
I hope you feel like giving me a complete explanation.

213
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,780
I'm the one who wants some explanations.

214
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,860
Arts Theater - Hakumeiza

215
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
The "Liber AL vel Legis" is a book written in code that can't be deciphered by anyone in this world.
Arts Theater - Hakumeiza

216
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,960
The "Liber AL vel Legis" is a book written in code that can't be deciphered by anyone in this world.

217
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,880
It is said that once deciphered, one can obtain an enormous amount of power.

218
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,980
Let me ask...

219
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,600
Is it that valuable?

220
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,730
It is also said that if put in actual use,

221
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,260
the present world, which the Religion of the Cross{in othe words Christianity} rules, will come to an end.

222
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,210
Can't you just burn the book. {So why not just burn it?}

223
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,790
Magic books don't burn.

224
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,250
At best, you can only seal it.

225
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,230
Uhh...

226
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,390
I would like to begin explaining the situation.

227
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,450
Touma!

228
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,680
Ouch...

229
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,480
Huh?

230
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,410
Hey! No! Stop!

231
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:46,330
Get away!

232
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,080
Touma, that's going beyond the limits of mischief!

233
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,270
Don't get aroused while working.

234
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,930
Currently, Orsola Acquinas is definitely in the hands of the Amakusa.

235
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,560
We suspect that about 50 members of Amakusa are involved in this incident.

236
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,770
They may already be above surface now.

237
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,860
In short, you know{understand} nothing?

238
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,790
We are tracking the Amakusa via traces of magic that have been left behind.

239
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,470
The Amakusa specialise in hiding and escaping and will not be captured easily.

240
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:28,960
But there is no way to break through our blockade.

241
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,540
Special movement method.

242
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Miniaturised pilgrimage.

243
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,480
It's magic usable only within Japan though.

244
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,180
Simply put, there are 47 special vortices within Japan.{WTF IS WHIRL?*}

245
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,420
They can jump between vortices freely.

246
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,430
It's a magic of the map.

247
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,810
We are finished if they use the vortex to jump!

248
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:51,680
Why're we still sitting around?

249
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,880
Because there is no need to hurry.

250
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,670
The Miniaturised pilgrimage is greatly affected by the movement of the stars.

251
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,450
While the special movement method can only be used at a certain time.

252
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:08,470
Restriction of the special movement method is only removed right after the date changes.

253
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,010
We have about four hours left.

254
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,010
Also, Touma...

255
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,870
Lend me the gadget that shows a map.

256
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:16,730
Oh, sure.

257
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,810
Here.

258
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:26,550
There's only one vortex within the blockade they can use.

259
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,160
It's here.

260
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,260
Well, then...

261
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,650
Is there anything I could help?

262
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
I told you many times to check properly!

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,570
Yes, I'm sorry.

264
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,450
I guess being a sister is tough too.

265
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,140
Oh, a tent for Index?

266
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:57,560
Huh?

267
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,400
Not in...

268
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,190
Geez, where did she go?

269
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
Over there!

270
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,440
Damn it!

271
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,260
Index!

272
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,390
The Amakusa?{Amakusa attacker}

273
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,510
H-Hey...

274
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,060
That... That thing...

275
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,490
Oh, it's just a slug.

276
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,650
A s-slug...

277
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,910
H-Hey, hang in there!

278
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,510
Touma?!

279
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,180
N-No...

280
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,090
I just thought the Amakusa assaulted us, you see...

281
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:54,750
Huh?

282
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:57,480
Please calm down, Index.

283
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,400
This is not what you usually are like...

284
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,700
You wouldn't be like this usually...

285
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,380
Like you usually do, come on and-

286
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:18,810
Hey, Steyr.

287
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,170
What?

288
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,890
I'm very annoyed at the moment.

289
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,660
Who's the girl that you like?

290
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,970
Hey, Steyr...

291
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,370
The woman whom I admire is Elizabeth the First.

292
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,680
The type of woman I like is Saint Martha.

293
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,960
The Amakusa is... You know...

294
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,560
The one that Kanzaki Kaori used to be part of.

295
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,750
Who did you hear that from?

296
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,870
Tsuchimikado?

297
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,740
Which means the Amakusas are Kanzaki's friends, right?

298
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:52,750
Despite that, are you still going to fight?

299
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,680
I will.

300
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,730
I have decided to do anything just to protect her.

301
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,410
So I will kill anyone.

302
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,210
I will burn anyone alive.

303
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:07,410
I will keep burning their corpses too.

304
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,480
I vowed to her long ago,

305
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:19,310
"Even if you forget everything, I will forget nothing and live for you and die for you."

306
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,730
Go to sleep.

307
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,410
Steyr?

308
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:36,190
It's not, so...

309
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,060
H-Hey wait, Index!

310
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:43,240
What, Touma?

311
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,540
Huh?

312
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,050
What? Agnese?!

313
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,300
Papa...

314
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,230
Papa?

315
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:56,490
A dream...

316
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,300
This is a dream...

317
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,810
So it's okay to bite Touma all I want.

318
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,910
It's okay to show him all the dissatisfaction from my daily life!

319
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,530
H-Hey wait, Index.

320
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,500
This is without a doubt real-

321
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,460
What misfortune!

322
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,520
Acting Pope,

323
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,100
all preparations for the Miniature pilgrimage are complete.

324
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:41,740
Now... Kanzaki Kaori,

325
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,940
I shall show you...

326
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:53,190
What we, the Amakusa Catholics, are like now with magic fused from diverse religions!

328
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,880
We dive into the vortex with the Roman Catholics.

329
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,630
After a huge clash, Tatemiya Saiji reveals the shocking truth.

330
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,380
And Orsola is...

331
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,910
Next episode, Amakusa.

332
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,000
When science and magic cross, the story begins.
