1
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:06,250
In a few minutes, the opening ceremony of Daihaseisai will begin.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,340
Here at the Academy City, it's crowded with visitors and the students' relatives everywhere.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,160
Maid Bentou~

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:18,120
How about {a speciality of the}one of Academy City's specialties, Maid Bentou~?

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,530
Rouran Housekeeping School's Maid Bentou,

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,580
More precisely, they are Maid-apprentice Bentou. How about one?

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,180
Oh my.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,300
The Academy City seems to have many different types of schools.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:35,610
Yeah, since it's like a place where all the educational facilities from around the world are concentrated in.

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,970
Oh, excuse me.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,870
Oh no, I'm sorry.

12
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,730
Do you happen to know where Tokiwadai Girl's School is?

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,010
Oh, give me a second.

14
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,520
Tokiwadai...

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,630
It's not here.

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,200
Maybe it's not open to the public.

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,280
Oh, really?

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,520
Then where did that Mikoto go?

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,550
I-Is that Mikoto-san your little sister or something?

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,670
Oh my. Touya-san, you're doing it again?

21
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,720
Oh, it really isn't there.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,330
Mother...{wife}

23
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,720
What should I do?

24
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,230
Oh, isn't that Touma-san?

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,670
Yeah, that's fine.

26
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,470
I'll take any punishment if I ever happen to lose to you. {If it happens that I ever lose to you, I'm fine to take any punishment.}

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,590
I'll do anything you say. {I'll follow any order you give me.}

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,980
All right. Accepted.{need to check these couple lines when raw finishes dl}

29
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,050
You said any, right?

30
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:28,480
But in exchange, if you lose, you'll be punished too. {you will also be punished, if you lose too.}

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,020
T-That means...

32
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,940
I'll have to do whatever you say...

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,450
Oh my.

34
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,100
You had such little confidence in your boasting?{nozo:You're all bark and no bite?}

35
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,320
Fine then.

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,660
I'll do it.

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,940
Don't go crying after I defeat you though. {Don't find yourself crying later!}

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,920
Oh my.

39
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,470
Mikoto-chan seems to be doing well.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,980
<b>Daihaseisai</b>

41
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,220
It's about time for the opening ceremony to start over there.
<b>Daihaseisai</b>

42
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,990
It's about time for the opening ceremony to start over there.

43
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,700
I was thinking that you will need to make a greeting or two.

44
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:35,960
You thought I'd appear in front of the public like this? {in this form}

45
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,640
Then we'll forget about it and continue with the discussion.

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,650
Is it about the magicians who snuck into the Academy City?

47
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,950
Finding weak points in the near impenetrable{not-easily-penetrated} security.

48
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,870
From what we have confirmed, {it is}there are two.

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,720
A high ranking Roman Catholic, and a carrier that's been contracted by her.

50
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,980
Their purpose seems to be the transaction of a certain item.

51
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,010
A certain item?

52
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,380
Here I go.

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,730
A sword?

54
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,050
While this is only a replica, it's a Stab Sword.

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:13,450
It's said to have pierced a dragon and pinned it to the ground.

56
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:19,310
If it gets into the wrong hands, the Anglican Church will quickly fall into a major crisis.

57
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,530
It's the equivalent of a strategic weapon in your world, I assume.

58
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:30,290
The biggest problem is that the transaction for the Stab Sword is {being done}will occur within the premises of Academy City.

59
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,700
That means...

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,210
We'll have no other choice but to use that boy as a guide for this trip.

61
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,860
Touma! Touma! I'm hungry.

62
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,710
Huh? You just had breakfast.

63
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,160
But there's a delectable {indescribable}scent all over the place. {coming from everywhere.}

64
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,990
I can't stop myself.

65
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:56,150
Oh, the culinary culture in Japan could be considered a lump of temptation with the name of "food".

66
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,270
Yeah, I got it.

67
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,200
I'll go around to visit the stands with you later.

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,230
Later?

69
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,120
The first event is about to begin.

71
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,290
These are the events that I will participate in today.

72
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,840
I marked them on this pamphlet.

73
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
Let's go, Index.

74
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,880
T-Touma, today might be extremely dry.

75
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,590
I don't have any enthusiasm.

76
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,340
Everyone... What is with this weary{worn down} atmosphere even though it's still the first day?

77
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,920
We had a huge discussion about how to win against other schools, but we already used up what little vitality we had{our already little vitality point to zero}.

78
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,440
That's called putting the cart before the horse!

79
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,610
Student athletic events aren't anything more than that.

80
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,120
What misfortune...

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,320
What is this spiritless state?

82
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,830
Don't tell me it was you, Kamijou, acting lazy for no reason and then infecting the others!?

83
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,200
I just got here.

84
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,580
So that means, because you came late, everyone lost their enthusiasm.

85
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,710
You arrived later than I did, Fukiyose!

86
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:02,380
I had my tasks as an{the(theres more than 1 commitee member) "an" has nothing to do with the number. aeiou in the mainword => a + "n" I was refering to how it sounds like she's the only admin officer, the main word starts with 'a' ok tards we got it :P} administration committee member, idiot!{for the event}

87
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,590
Administration Committee Member
I had my tasks as an{the(theres more than 1 commitee member) "an" has nothing to do with the number. aeiou in the mainword => a + "n" I was refering to how it sounds like she's the only admin officer, the main word starts with 'a' ok tards we got it :P} administration committee member, idiot!{for the event}

88
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:04,630
I had my tasks as an{the(theres more than 1 commitee member) "an" has nothing to do with the number. aeiou in the mainword => a + "n" I was refering to how it sounds like she's the only admin officer, the main word starts with 'a' ok tards we got it :P} administration committee member, idiot!{for the event}

89
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,580
Leave me alone please.

90
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:11,410
Facing a misfortunate reality, Kamijou-san is now unable to stand up.

91
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,210
That's called a mild anemia.

92
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,520
Here, hydrate{resupply} yourself with a sports drinks.

93
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:22,150
I really hate those people who aren't serious with their lives and use an excuse like being misfortunate or unlucky!

94
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,150
If a person like you becomes lazy, that will cause a loss of enthusiasm for the others around you!

95
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,150
So straighten up, will you?

96
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,030
Huh?

97
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,900
Uh... Um...

98
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,310
You see...

99
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,620
Anything wrong?

100
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,890
Nothing at all!

101
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,720
No one is in the right state of mind for stick toppling.{I think they push over sticks to make it topple}

102
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,400
We really might fail.

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
We realise that there are shortcomings in our facilities.

104
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,900
But that's in no way the students' responsibility!

105
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:07,860
The Administrative Directors Committee won't allow a supplementary budget because of the low quality of students.{It's because of the low quality of students that the Administrative Directors Commitee won't allow supplementary budget.}

106
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,060
It must be troublesome to take care of failures.

107
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,790
There is no such thing as a successful or a failing student!

108
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,230
They all have their own personal traits!

109
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,770
That's such a dreamlike option.{feel like there's a better word for this, Nozomori}

110
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:24,010
In the stick toppling that is about to start now...

111
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:28,600
I'll destroy your failing students so badly that they {have no chance of recovery}won't be able to recover!

112
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,480
That's wrong, right?

113
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,760
You all aren't failing students...

114
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,990
Hey everyone...

115
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,860
I'll ask you again.

116
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,110
Do you honestly not have any enthusiasm?

117
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,420
First event, Stick Toppling.

118
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,000
The participating schools are now entering the field.

119
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,040
He's so reckless.

120
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,420
There's no way he can win against our school.

121
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,180
I'm hungry.

122
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,630
You don't have heat stroke or anything, do you?{Nozomori changed this back, but I'm almost certain "don't have heat stroke" is wrong.}

123
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,100
You really are just hungry.

124
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,760
What are you doing here, short hair?

125
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,920
Cheering for Touma?

126
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,210
Huh? W-Why do I have to cheer for him?

127
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,450
We're having a bet with each other over which of our schools is going to win.

128
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,880
Of course, I'll win.

129
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,150
Oh? What should I do if I do win?

130
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,370
He'll listen to whatever I say...

131
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,780
Oh, it's Touma!

132
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,630
What is that strong will power?

133
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,200
Don't tell me they're seriously going for a win.

134
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,220
What's he trying to get from me after winning?!

135
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,420
Ready, set,

136
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,180
Go!

137
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,990
Why are you trying so hard to win? {Why did you try so hard that you become like that?}

138
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:24,080
Even if you do win, it's tough for me to see you all so beat up{battered}...

139
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,040
Hey, Index.

140
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:32,000
Geez, she's always like this.

141
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh yeah, my mobile phone.

142
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,220
It must be in my bag.

143
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:56,860
Huh?

144
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:09,500
T-This only happened because I came here to get my mobile phone, so that I can meet up with a missing person...{Nozomori? :) thanks}

145
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,340
I didn't have any ulterior motives...{erotic}

146
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,300
Huh?

147
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,220
Oh there you were, Touma!

148
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,460
Huh?

149
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,840
Why are you crying? {filled with tears}

150
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,480
Where is your mobile?

151
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,720
It's right here! {I have it here!}

152
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,480
Then why didn't you pick up?

153
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,080
The battery ran out...

154
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,330
More importantly, I'm hungry.

155
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:38,670
Let me eat something, Touma.

156
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,550
If we go to the food stands area, there would be a mountainful of food.{umm help with a word for mountainful}

157
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:43,830
A mountainful?

158
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,680

3 km?

170
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,800
It's so close, I can reach it with my hand...

171
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,980
You'll have to endure until the Huge Ball rolling event finishes.

172
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,390
Touma~

173
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,820
Huh?

174
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,430
Why?

175
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,940
Hey!

176
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,440
Huh?

177
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,890
I've caught you, my condition for victory!

178
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,790
For the Rental Run Competition, the first place contestant is Misaka Mikoto, from Tokiwadai Junior High.

A rental run competition?

182
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,340
Right.

183
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,190
A high school student that competed in the first event.

184
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,420
Even someone like you fits under that condition, right?

185
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:45,960
There were countless others who would have fit that condition-

186
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,140
What are you doing, all of a sudden?

187
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,920
Hey, drink this.

188
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,340
Fine, I'll give you this!

189
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,990
Huh?

190
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:20,050
Oh my, after imagining Shirai-san taking a rest while we are working hard under the blazing sun, I couldn't keep still.

191
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,070
I felt like having you help with the work.

192
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:28,460
Thank you so much for the all-so-wonderful-friendship.

193
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,260
And?

194
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,250
Did some problems occur?

195
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,360
Nothing as of now.

Contestant Misaka Mikoto, who took first place, has not eased off even after crossing the finish line.

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,490
We got completely separated...

212
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,260
Are you doing okay, Index?

213
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,770
Oh...

214
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,720
He's...

215
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:31,910
They are now reducing the security level to permit normal guests in.

{So using that chance, magicians are sneaking inside.}Magicians are using this chance to sneak inside.

217

We have confirmed two.

218
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,000
Lidvia Lorenzetti from the Roman Catholics,

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,720
and a carrier she hired, Oriana Thomson.

220
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,110
A carrier?

221
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:52,090
They are trying to make a transaction of ceremonial items traditionally owned by the church.

222
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,700
Why at a place like this?

223
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,390
Isn't the Academy City one of the most distant places {when it comes to}regarding occult matters?

224
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,960
That's exactly why.

225
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,740
{This place here is difficult for both the Academy City and the Magicians to intervene.}This place is difficult for the Academy City and the Magicians to interfere.

226
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,310
The only people who can really do anything {make their move} are your contacts that came to Academy City.

227
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,960
Then what about Kanzaki?

228
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,410
If I remember correctly, she was something like a saint.

229
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:15,000
Kanzaki can't be used.

230
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,800
Especially for this situation.

231
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,170
The ceremonial item that's suppose to be transacted is a very special type.{Since the ceremonial item that is suppose to be transacted is special.}

232
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,650
Huh?

233
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,420
What do you mean?

234
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,130
Kami-san, The Stab Sword is the name of the ceremonial item.

235
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,840
It's something that's supposed to be able to instantly slay any saint with just one stab.

236
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,710
Watch out!

237
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,920
Noo!

238
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,640
Why?

239
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,650
What are you doing, Kamijou Touma!

240
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,740
Kami-yan, do you remember how God's Child on the cross was killed?

241
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,750
If I remember...

242
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,700
He was crucified and...

243
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,700
He was stabbed to death.

244
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,180
The Stab Sword is a ceremonial item that has the religious impact of the execution and brutal killing extracted,

245
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,420
amplified, concentrated, and converged to the highest limit.

246
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,470
It doesn't have any effect on ordinary humans, but if it's against a Saint, it has the power to kill them with one strike.

247
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,010
What are the Magicians trying to accomplish by having a transaction of these kind of goods?

248
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,170
A war, of course.

249
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,020
Saints in the Magician world are close to what a nuclear weapon is in the normal world.

250
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,520
But there are plenty of Magicians other than saints, right?

251
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,540
It seems like you could fight even without Kanzaki.

252
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,690
That's not the problem.

253
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,730
It's not a matter of being able to actually win.

254
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:40,630
But just by {making them}having the impression that they may be able to win would cause an outbreak of war{a war would happen.}.

255
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,710
But then if it's such a serious issue, shouldn't we ask Index for cooperation?

256
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,430
That won't do.

257
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,750
We can't use the Index Librorum Prohibitorum for this issue.

258
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,220
Nor can we even have her come near the scene of the incident,

259
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,940
and we mustn't {tell her any information}inform her about the incident.

260
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,270
Why not?

261
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,450
If something were to happen, then she would be in the center of it.

262
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:07,230
That's what the Magicians outside have their eyes on.

263
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:14,190
If she makes a move, the Magicians that notice it would all swarm in. That's just how it is.

Academy City Bus - Behind Central Gym

265
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:21,710
So we have to do something while preventing Index from noticing the magic?

When I arrived at the scene after receiving Yomikawa-sensei's call...

268
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,740
You were completely dehydrated like vegetables that were left out in a supermarket for way too long.

269
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,920
I was very worried.

270
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,040
Thank you for the meal!

271
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,440
But really, where is Touma?

272
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,980
It should be lunch time soon.

273
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,520
Umm lunch? But you just now...

274
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,480
I...

275
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,780
{Will I be separated from Touma all day like this?}Will Touma and I be separated like this all day long?

276
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,290
You're right.

277
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,490
Sister-chan would want to enjoy the Daihaseisai together with Kamijou-chan as well.

278
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,730
Oh, it will be all right!

279
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,300
There's even an event that you can participate in!

280
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,460
Huh?

281
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,810
She's not here.

282
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:16,580
Is she seriously lost?

283
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,350
Huh?

284
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:24,190
{Why do you have a face like a hero's party just before appearing in front of the final boss?}Why do you have the look of a hero just before he fights the final boss?

285
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,310
You look like you're about to die soon. {lol}

286
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,150
If you're hungry, would you like a bentou?

287
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,520
More importantly, have you seen Index anywhere?

288
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,360
If you're talking about that sister, then she was walking that way.

289
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,940
Thank you!

290
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,160
She was being pulled by the hand of the famous miniature teacher from your school.

291
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,500
Index?

292
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,690
Oh, it's only you... {It was only you}

293
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,430
Where's Index?

294
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,780
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,960
It feels wrong making you change in a location like this.

296
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,500
Touma!

297
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,380
You should count and see how many times you have done this to me including right now!

298
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,970
Umm well...

299
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,240
Index-san, it's okay.

300
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,650
It was just an accident.

301
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,450
You don't have to be so serious.{why so serious}

302
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,470
Kamijou.

303
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,780
After coming here in search of Tsukuyomi-sensei for Administrative Committee work...

304
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,970
What are you doing...?

305
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,020
You traitor!

306
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,650
Can't you at least put in the slightest effort to try to make this event successful?

307
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,640
What event is our school participating in now?

308
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,820
Why can't you even remember that?

309
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,650
I got it!

310
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,790
Since it seems like your brain is lacking nutrients, you should take in some sugar!

311
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,800
Even if you do that, you won't fix Kamijou-san's stupidity!

312
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,060
Doesn't it make you feel sad to say that?

313
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,290
The 2nd year girl's tug of war, and the 3rd year boys representative student's triathalon.

314
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,790
{Which do you want to cheer?}Which one would you prefer to cheer for?

315
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,440
Of course you want to go to the girls event, right?

316
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,060
No surprise there, since it's Kamijou, after all.

317
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,940
I've had enough collar pulling.

318
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
Then...

319
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,120
Hurry up now.

320
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,210
Hey, Kamijou.

321
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,950
Is the Daihaseisai boring?

322
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,170
Huh?

323
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,690
It's like you don't seem focused.

324
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,230
It's as if something is distracting you,.

325
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,270
If you thought today was boring,

326
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:01,780
then it means I didn't do a proper job somewhere when I prepared for this event as the Administrative Committee member.

327
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:03,680
It's not that I think it's boring or anything.

328
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,720
As one of the people who has prepared and worked hard up to this date,

329
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,590
I feel I would like all of you to share happy memories.

330
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,900
I might be selfish though...

331
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,490
So there is something bothering you after all!

332
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,050
It's not like that!

333
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,400
Oh, sorry!

334
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,490
Wha?!

335
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,500
Get away from me, Kamijou Touma!

336
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,280
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,220
I'm just not used to crowded places like this.{this?}

338
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,180
Oh no.

339
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,150
Are you all right?

340
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,450
Have you hurt yourself anywhere?

341
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,000
Your forehead is all red.

342
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,600
Oh no...

343
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,440
To repay for hitting you...

344
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,060
Would you rather have a kiss?

345
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,210
Yes, I would want a kiss-

346
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,870
Ouch...

347
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,030
Then...

348
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,750
I should get back to work now.

349
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,610
Good bye.

350
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,180
Hello?

351
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,090
This is Oriana Thomson.

352
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,160
Do you hear me?

353
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,960
Refrain from using your real name.

354
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,140
Your voice can be heard in the surroundings.

355
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,330
More importantly, I'm experiencing some trouble.

356
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,340
It seems the spell I was using has been overcome.{overcome?}

357
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,360
And the cause?

358
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,720
I don't know.

359
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,530
But it excites me. {this maker her wet}

360
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,500
Refrain from making lewd expressions.

361
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,630
{Your countermeasure is}How do you plan to counter this?

362
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,270
Let me see.

363
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:52,270
I shall have to shake off that boy behind me.
