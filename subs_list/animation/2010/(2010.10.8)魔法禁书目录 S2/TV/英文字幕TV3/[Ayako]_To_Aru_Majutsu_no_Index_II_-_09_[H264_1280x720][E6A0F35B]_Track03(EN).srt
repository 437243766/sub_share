1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,940
The Academy city is in high spirits from the Daihaseisai.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:09,280
Using that chance, a ceremonial item, the Stab Sword, which can slay a saint in one strike, is being transacted.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,200
The name of the carrier is Oriana Thomson.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,610
By coincidence, I came into contact with a person who resembled her...

5
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:55,340
<b>Route Disturb</b>

6
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,390
Hello, Kami-yan.

7
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,390
Currently,{Right now} we are heading to places which Oriana might use to carry out the transaction-

8
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,850
Tsuchimikado, the moment I shook hands with her{made a handshake with a person},

9
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,020
my imagine breaker dispelled something.

10
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,860
I don't know what it was though.

11
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,870
She didn't look like a student.

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,780
Didn't she carry something big with her?

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,750
Yeah, she had something that looked like a road sign.

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,910
Where are you now, Kami-yan?

15
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,960
I'm currently tailing her.{I'm following after her.} {I'm chasing her.}

16
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,880
I'll send you the GPS coordinates of this location{place}.

17
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,420
Do a search on your side too.

18
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,710
She noticed me following her!

19
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,610
Which one, Kami-yan?

20
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:05,000
That blond woman wearing a factory work outfit.

21
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,190
Those two seem to be professionals.

22
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,630
I was told they can't use force inside the city areas,

23
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,500
but I guess they won't go easy on me.

24
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,850
Her movements are somewhat weird.

25
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,730
Did she change her mind?

26
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,370
A bus terminal?

27
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,570
It's the maintenance yard for automated buses.

28
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,840
A trap!

29
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,620
Get down, Kami-yan!

30
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,330
Here's where you show your power.

31
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,760
You bastard!

32
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,140
Oh, I must say that was some excellent teamwork. {a well coordinated assult?}

33
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,010
It's easier to take action if our roles are well defined.

34
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,010
Why, you-!

35
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,100
So go serve your purpose!

36
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,680
I said wait!

37
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,160
Stiyl, place your rune cards and stand by.

38
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,820
We will take the carrier down.

39
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,370
Understood.

40
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,520
What will you do, Kami-yan?

41
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,800
I believe it's probably safer for you to stay here though.

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,710
I will...

43
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:42,390
I, too, believe it's safer that you stay here.

44
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,510
What I mean is, it becomes safe for me, though.

45
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,940
These are just decoys to keep us busy.

46
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,070
We'll let her escape if we take countermeasures against all of them.

47
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,900
Even though you told me that...{You can just tell me that though...}

48
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,240
There she is!

49
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,500
Kami-yan, please.

50
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,290
Please? What?

51
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,390
Damn it.

52
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,420
Oriana Thomson, the Route Disturb...

53
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,790
Making a joke out of us...

54
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,630
We're so sorry!

55
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,340
Are you okay?

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,470
Oh no, I also owe you an apology.{Oh no, rather I am the one who should be sorry.}

57
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,560
This spell is a Rihashijin Circle.{logical fraction four circle}

58
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,770
We will search for Oriana's position using this.

59
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,810
Wouldn't it be bad for you if you use magic?

60
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,650
That's why I'm going to ask for help.

61
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,030
Oh...

62
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,580
Communicate through the wind,

63
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,500
Not to the air, but communicate the intention to the field.

64
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,860
"Communicate through the wind, "

65
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,150
"Not to the air, but communicate the intention to the field."

66
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:07,990
Right?

67
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,870
Stiyl!

68
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,760
Kami-yan!

69
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,950
Hit Stiyl's body!

70
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,510
What was that...?

71
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:34,810
A type of counter magic against tracing?

72
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,660
No, there are no such artifacts of them.

73
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:45,410
There was probably a counter response magic already set to fire when it identifies your individual magic power.

74
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:47,190
What the heck is that?

75
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,240
So it means Stiyl can't use magic against Oriana anymore?

76
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,620
Damn her.

77
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,950
What an annoying magic she cast.

78
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:06,370
With {only? }one body she is detecting vital signs, analyzing it, reversing assembly, application and even counter action...from "Route Disturb".

79
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,960
"Route Disturb"?

80
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,500
Oriana Thomson's nickname.

81
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:18,140
But anyways, I seem to recall this way of doing things that seems to lack any sense of humanity...

82
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,640
No way...

83
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,400
I can't imagine she would have that.{she would have what that?}

84
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,270
No Stiyl.

85
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,480
I had the same thoughts{idea} too.

86
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,110
Seriously?

87
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,790
But if that's so, then that means she isn't a magician, but a wizard.

88
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,660
What do you mean by that?

89
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,240
What the hell are you{is the thing you are} talking about? {What the fuck are you talking about?}

90
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,740
With knowledge of magic stuffed into an object,

91
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,840
it emits a magic circle by itself, without needing a spellcaster to take action.

92
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,160
That's the original intent of a magic book.

93
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,500
But creating magic books depending on the situation is...

94
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,590
How could she do that?

95
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,260
While they are originals, they are written sloppily. {quick way of writting, so it's really looking... unreadable, but its readable.}

96
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,770
They should only have limited effects and break down quickly.

97
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,390
Something that would be called Short Hand, I guess?

98
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,850
So what do we have to do then?

99
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:10,330
First we destroy the auto counter-attack spell, allowing Stiyl to use his magic.

100
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:14,480
How high is the possibility that she'd escape beyond search range while we do that?

101
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:19,530
If she was confident that she could escape immediately, she wouldn't have to cast a counter spell.

102
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,990
Don't you believe so?

103
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,490
Stiyl, cast something, anything.

104
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,890
Senjutsu Enjin.{fortune telling(psychic/divination?) circle; lets keep it as japanese, lol.}

105
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:34,860
It's an unused magic circle which has had no one's magical powers been through.

106
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,970
This will start detecting the counter spells and figure out the direction and distance.

107
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,680
So then...

108
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,350
Hey Tsuchimikado, if you execute something like that,

109
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,600
Stiyl will once more be-

110
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,870
Once more?

111
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,230
Who said that?

112
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,570
If we can't find the position of the Short Hands, we will have to have him try as many times. {we will have him try until we got all of 'em?}

113
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,900
Damn you!

114
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,370
Kami-yan, since you seem to have forgotten, I'll remind you of one thing.

115
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,580
This is a battle that we risk lives for.

116
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,030
Depending on the outcome, countries and even the world's fate could be affected greatly.

117
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,200
Let's go with that plan.

118
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,370
But you-

119
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,720
Quit the friendly-cosy attitude, Kamijou Touma.

120
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,560
If that lets us finish everything, then there's nothing wrong with that.

121
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,970
Find the position of the counter spell, no matter what.

122
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,430
Okay.

123
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,230
Defending Index's life at Academy City at all cost,

124
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,180
that was the condition, right?

125
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,600
Kamijou Touma,

126
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:37,780
I am not happy that you are here now.

127
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,960
Why are you not by her side?

128
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,400
If her face becomes unhappy because of that,

129
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,660
it's all your fault!

130
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,770
Even though I went through all the trouble of changing just to see Touma...

131
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,150
He seems to have just run off on his own.

132
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,230
Sister-chan, don't get so depressed.

133
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,690
Kamijou-chan must have had a very good reason to do so.

134
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,530
Kamijou Touma...

135
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,290
Disappearing the second I let my eyes off him...

136
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,670
Geez.

137
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,090
Oh, Sensei?

138
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:34,130
Fukiyose-chan?

139
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,790
What are you doing out here in public?

140
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,010
If she's confused, we can use a stimulant such as red pepper to distract her-

141
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,970
No she's all right.

142
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,260
She's absolutely fine, Fukiyose-chan.

143
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,640
Really?

144
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,350
Touma...

145
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,450
Where did Touma go?

146
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,610
Look, it shows up.

147
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,660
There's a response from the Senjutsu Enjin.

148
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,320
Hey Kami-yan, don't you have a map?

149
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:11,540
Oh, there's a GPS map on my mobile phone.

150
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,290
Then I can...

151
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,710
Tsuchimikado!

152
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,050
How can you be so cold?!

153
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,840
Who do you think Stiyl was injured for?

154
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,130
Kami-yan, he's a professional magician too.

155
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:27,760
He has some resistance to magic attacks.

156
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:32,190
Tsuchimikado, you're...

157
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,080
The Senjutsu Enjin reacts to magic power that comes shooting through, and tells you the direction and distance.

158
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:44,530
There's no way such a useful article can be used without using magic power.

159
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,030
If I could properly use magic, Stiyl wouldn't have had to suffer like this.

160
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,130
I would admit that.

161
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,780
So hate me as much as you want.

162
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,670
But I will surely find the Short Hands, and destroy them.

163
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:06,180
And I will also find Oriana, and stop the transaction of{screw} the Stab Sword with my very own hands.

164
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,630
Kami-yan, the map.

165
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,690
I want to find out what is there 302 meters to the Northwest of here.

166
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:15,690
The Short Hands should be there.

167
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,110
Y-Yeah...

168
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,900
T-This is...

169
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,740
A middle school?

170
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,620
Middle school ball throwing tournament starts in 10 minutes!

171
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,080
The stadium?

172
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,910
There's no time left before it starts! {No time left before it's starting!}

173
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,580
There's guests, and even the camera is in already.

174
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,250
We can't do it secretly anymore!

175
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,170
What should we do then?

176
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,890
We can't leave it as it is.

177
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,380
We will have to sneak in as competitors.

178
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,180
Are you seriously saying that?

179
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,970
We're high school students, you know?  {'ya kno~?}

180
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,390
It's impossible to mix in with middle school-

181
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,220
Damn it!

182
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:00,070
That counter spell might hit bystanders as well.

183
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:00,600
Huh?

184
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,600
Do you know what the easiest castable spell in this world is?

185
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,110
It's touching.

186
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:12,530
Even people who can't cast magic can cause the counter spell to react by merely touching.

187
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,660
And due to them having no magical defence ability, it'll get really dangerous if that happens.

188
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,300
Anyway Kami-yan, we need to get rid of that counter spell before there are any victims.

189
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,250
Understood!

190
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,710
And so...

191
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,600
Kami-yan!

192
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,810
I'm sorry.

193
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:47,030
Our event is coming up next, are we going to have to show up dressed like this?

194
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,160
The cameras are rolling too.

195
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,230
This is bad.

196
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,030
Don't you have spare gym uniforms{suits}?

197
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,290
Oh right, I have some.

198
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,910
But they're still in the clubhouse.

199
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,380
Well, go change quickly then.

200
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,040
{Since it's the rule}I'll have to check your ID in accordance to the rules.

201
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,080
Tsuchimika...

202
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,170
Here then.

203
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,970
Hey!

204
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,050
Wipe your hand before using it!

205
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:17,430
Fine then, go in already!

206
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,350
They won't allow you to participate after it begins!

207
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,220
Thank you!

208
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,850
Hey, we can't mix in the event dressed like this-

209
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:31,690
Don't worry, it's known that they have spare gym uniforms{suits} in the nurse's office.

210
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,500
The next even is the ball throwing battle between the 200 handpicked members of Minamisawa Middle School against...

211
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,290
20 handpicked members of Tokiwadai Middle School.

212
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,040
Middle school ball throwing tournament starts in 5 minutes!
20 handpicked members of Tokiwadai Middle School.

213
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,370
20 handpicked members of Tokiwadai Middle School.

214
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,600
They reek of a lost battle.

215
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,390
How smelly.

216
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,490
Why the heck are you...!

217
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,240
What the hell are you doing there?

218
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,650
Hey!

219
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,070
What? Tokiwadai Middle School?

220
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:18,030
They have scary ability users over there!

221
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, we should watch out for stray shots Kami-yan.

222
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:26,880
If she would have set up a Short Hand, where would it be?

223
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,020
First of all, I think the baskets are suspicious.

224
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,840
There should be ones borrowed from outside.

225
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,520
She could have set them up before they were brought in here.

226
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,440
I'll check the baskets one by one.

227
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,430
Kami-yan, it's your job after I find the Short Hand.

228
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,110
On your mark,

229
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:48,940
Ready, set,

230
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,480
Go!

231
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,910
Don't be startled!

232
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,330
We're breaking through, Kami-yan!

233
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:00,660
Y-Yeah!

234
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,060
Tsuchimikado?

235
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,180
It's a miss, Kami-yan!

236
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:17,920
Let's move on to the next one.

237
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,930
Kami-yan, it's not this one either.

238
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
Watch out!

239
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,250
Kami-yan, use my back!

240
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,500
Hurry up and escape!

241
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,490
Do you...

242
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,700
really want to punish me so badly?

243
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,420
Geez!

244
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,510
Don't be so reckless!

245
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,010
Misaka!

246
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,780
Wait, Misaka.

247
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,530
W-What?

248
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:48,270
Listen, Misaka.

249
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,990
I'll properly tell you the reason later.

250
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,800
So get away from here!

251
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,060
Huh?

252
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,570
What are you telling me all of a sudden?

253
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,570
Why are you even here in the first place?

254
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,360
Explain that to me first-

255
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:05,570
Quit getting in the way!

256
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,550
Misaka, can you please come over here without asking any questions{ask no more and come this way}.

257
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,200
Huh?

258
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,160
It's dangerous over there.

259
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,090
You're an idiot!

260
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:23,760
I could have solved it without your help anyway.

261
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:26,350
What do you need to talk about{is the talk you have} anyway?

262
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,800
I said I'll tell you later!

263
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,510
It's dangerous over there!

264
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,390
I don't want you to be injured!{misakamisakamisakamisakamisakaaaaaargghhhhhhhh}

265
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,980
You're an idiot.

266
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,070
You don't need to be so worried about me in an event like this...

267
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,040
Geez, don't surprise me by suddenly telling me something really strange like that-

268
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,240
What?!

269
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,680
Keep quiet.

270
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,090
Just stay still for a second.

271
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,300
No...

272
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,640
No way.

273
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,680
Damn it!

274
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,690
Does it hurt that much, Misaka?

275
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,600
Is your fever-

276
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,940
It's nothing!

277
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,310
Tsuchimikado, the pole over here has-

278
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:20,660
Daihaseisai Administration Committee

279
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,530
Oh no.
Daihaseisai Administration Committee

280
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,070
Daihaseisai Administration Committee

281
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,280
Kamijou Touma, what are you doing here?

282
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,580
I saw you running off in a hurry.

283
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,080
What are you doing here now?

284
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,000
Anyways, we're going to restart the event.{the event will be restarted from the beginning.}

285
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,250
Fukiyose!

286
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,210
W-What?!

287
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,980
Kami-yan, hit Fukiyose!

288
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,640
She's not a magician. {She is no magician.}

289
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,850
At this rate, her body won't last any longer.

290
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,540
Fukiyose, are you all right?

291
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,030
Fukiyose!

292
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,550
Fine, Oriana Thomson,

293
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,940
If this is your way of doing things,

294
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,320
After getting a countless number of innocent people involved,

295
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,940
if you don't feel anything after doing that,

296
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:49,240
I will completely destroy{your senseless illusion,},

297
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,830
{I will kill without trace}your senseless illusion with my very own hands!

So did Stiyl and Tsuchimikado.

303
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,840
If the Stab Sword was the cause of this battle,

304
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,000
I will surely break that thing!

305
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,880
Next episode, Short Hand.

306
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:39,350
When science and magic cross, the story begins.
