1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,630
I would like it if you were to take it easy on me, ability user.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,440
Komaba Ritoku.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,320
How fortunate of me to run into the target that's on my side of the attack.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:19,550
Abolishing all our extended money storages makes it looks like we're childish.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,930
All I did was destroy what I intended to destroy.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,590
I don't care whether it was your funds or not.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,330
You're a move-point ability user.

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,760
What a troublesome ability.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,380
Do you think that you can pin me down just by realizing how troublesome my ability is?

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,990
Well, something like that.

11
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,890
It's more than troublesome. For me, it's highly despised.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,640
I'll stab you in two seconds and bring this to an end.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:45,730
Too slow.

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,320
I'm quite serious about this.

15
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:10,630
If I were to fight a monster like you, wouldn't it be all right to have a handicap?

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,590
You won't hit me.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,560
That mobility of yours... You have hard tape inside your clothes, don't you?

18
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,880
It was very difficult to obtain this military-grade, ultrasonic wave, elastic tape.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,570
Did you believe using it in such a simple manner wouldn't have side-effects?

20
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,570
I prepared myself for that.

21
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,840
Let's finish this now.

22
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,370
I have a lot of things left for me to finish.

23
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,340
You're pretty weak!

24
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:02,720
I won't be stopped by such futile resistance!

25
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,110
She didn't last.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,640
<b>Skill-Out
Armed group</b>

27
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,240
Now then...
<b>Skill-Out
Armed group</b>

28
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,390
<b>Skill-Out
Armed group</b>

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,210
It seems that it has already ended.
<b>Skill-Out
Armed group</b>

30
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,570
It seems that it has already ended.

31
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,660
How sad. Pulling overtime alone is...

32
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,530
If that's the case, then why don't you take a break?

33
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,340
What?

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,510
Accelerator, is it?

35
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:42,100
You're Komaba Ritoku, aren't you?

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,320
Let me ask you; why are you doing this?

37
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,240
There isn't anything of interest in listening to why Skill-Out is attacking ability users.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,000
So you want to attack the entire city at random after bringing it to a halt?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,920
Not entirely at random. We do select our targets.

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,570
You do seem to be pretty calm.

41
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,620
Are you now aware of the situation?

42
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,620
I killed her.

43
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,150
Although, it was slightly different from what I heard.

44
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,880
The crooked power holders should go all out at this point.

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,010
Did you know? The pieces of shit that stand before me will get cut into pieces.

46
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,010
That diode... It's transferring and processing some kind of electronic signal.

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,000
What are those...?

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,760
Chaff seeds.

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,740
They are a counter-measure against electronic radars.

50
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,370
You bastard...

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,960
Time to be cut into pieces.

52
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,740
Checkmate.

53
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,650
At your final moment before dying, decide where you wish to be shot.

54
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,340
Are you also going to take out your wrath on those who are innocent?

55
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,400
Don't fuck with me, you piece of shit!

56
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,550
Why is your reflection ability still functional?

57
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,510
Aren't you a fool!

58
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:53,880
Chaff is made of little pieces of metal in the air that interfere with radar.

59
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,580
The answer is simple.

60
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:00,660
Just vent the metal and create a breathing space.

61
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's see what happens when you challenge a level five even though you're just a level zero.

62
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,730
Too slow.

63
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,800
You said that this was checkmate, right?

64
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,170
Just because you're a level zero doesn't make you evil.

65
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,390
People say that you guys are problematic, since people like Skill-Out are creating problems.

66
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,920
Rights? Safety? Nonsense.

67
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,760
Didn't you at least realize that those actions were closing down specifically on you?

68
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,190
Let's talk about a "what if" situation.

69
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,110
When humanity doesn't act on those people who are great ability users...

70
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,970
There are a lot of ugly people on the inside who have enormous power. {69-70 TLC to see if we can have them match I did the best I could to make this a sentence}

71
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:09,340
If those guys try to kill all the other level zeros instead of Skill-Out, then what would you do?

72
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,730
I already knew something like this would occur.

73
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,860
You bastard...

74
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,740
It seems like... We're both in the same situation now.

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,690
This is a souvenir.

76
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,740
Just engrave this horrific sight into your memories.

77
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,740
Very nicely done.

78
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,720
We will be performing the eradication of proof and the corpse removal.

79
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,580
I'm sending that garbage truck, so please get on that.

80
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,030
No, I'll just go home like this.

81
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't mind, but please refrain from running into any known face.

82
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,680
We don't want to be mixed...

83
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,040
You are alive, right?

84
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,280
Musujime Awaki!

85
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,370
I had showed it to you at some point, but when did you notice anyway?

86
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,030
You're all out and easy to find.

87
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,740
Playing like that.

88
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,260
Is it all right for you to use that kind of language in front of your life-saver?

89
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,090
My life-saver? Keep blabbing till you die.

90
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,420
Oh my, do you have somewhere to go?

91
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,760
Nothing important, just overtime.

92
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,570
Service Overtime.

93
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:44,560
{Intermission}

94
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,410
I was late for that overtime.

95
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,750
I think I'll go buy coffee or something from the convenient store.

96
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
I bleel blad...

97
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,330
That face...

98
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,590
I've seen it somewhere!

99
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,210
What is this?

100
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,210
Yes, yes. I am Misaka Misuzu.

101
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,560
Why you...

102
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,150
My hobbies are studying the numbers, especially swimming.

103
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:35,070
My bust size is 91 centimeters!

104
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,070
Damn it, I forgot that I was married.

105
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,230
Come on... Papa will get mad, so don't touch me here and there.

106
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,090
Where is the Database-center for Dangai University?

107
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:50,250
Hey whitey, you know something?

108
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,630
Come on now, don't ignore me!

109
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,730
Because I need to go there to study you know!

110
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,990
Like hell I'd know.

111
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,920
Take a taxi or something.

112
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,510
If they're younger than me, I'll kiss girls and boys without any limits.

113
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,340
Don't keep blabbing things that make no damn sense!

114
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,320
If you say that, then Crocket becomes some type of nabe-meat type food.

115
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,040
You have to put the bread crumbs into the meat and then put it into the oil.

116
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,250
It might be possible that it's tasty because it was made fresh.

117
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:36,660
Well then, it should be tasty if Touma made the food in front of my eyes, so that I could eat it while it's that fresh.

118
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,320
Hey, hey, you, you are...
Well then, it should be tasty if Touma made the food in front of my eyes, so that I could eat it while it's that fresh.

119
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,750
Hey, hey, you, you are...

120
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,570
M-Misaka-san!

121
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:44,730
Misuzu-san is already going to sleep.

122
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:49,520
Damn I even forgot to do my stretches or take off my makeup while I was on a roll.{TLC: DONE}

123
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,730
Damn it... I can't believe I have to work at a time like this.

124
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,210
Yay, I captured a boy younger than me.

125
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:07,150
What are you doing wandering around at this time of night? What would happen if Mikoto-chan were to find out?

126
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,370
Help me! Index!

127
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,380
Come to think of it, who is that girl over there?

128
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,310
No one in particular, actually, there isn't any need to introduce myself to a person like you.

129
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,710
Why you little!?!

130
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,990
I'm Index, my name is Index!

131
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,460
Hey, hey, do you know where the Database-center for the Dangai University is?

132
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,450
Huh?

133
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,810
I was told that the University report that I need to write is only found in Academy City.

134
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,110
I had no choice but to come all this way.

135
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,400
Oh, I see.

136
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,360
I know, let's exchange our phone numbers and addresses, okay?

137
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,680
What the?!

138
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,900
I put your number in the friends category, okay?

139
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,760
Misaka... Is it a coincidence?

140
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,730
No... Does it have anything to do with that brat?

141
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,100
Accelerator, do you have any business with me?

142
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,930
I was cut in!

143
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,710
You do have a weird taste. So you're the upper command of the group?

144
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,280
I can answer all your questions.

145
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
I don't have any!

146
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,390
I will do my things on my own.

147
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,280
Your business, is it?

148
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,770
What a way to put it!

149
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,200
I had a bit of business to do myself, well...

150
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,590
Perfect timing.

151
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,090
It's about to start.

152
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:33,940
What?

153
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:42,340
Misaka Misuzu-sama had applied to use the Dangai University Database-center, so we attacked it.

154
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,300
You attacked it.

155
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,380
Attacked?

156
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,090
Yes.

157
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,910
What is that Misaka?

158
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,350
She is the mother of Misaka Mikoto.

159
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,800
Are you aware of the recovery movement?

160
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,060
Something about recovering their child before the war takes place.

161
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,320
If a lot of students were to suddenly leave Academy city, then it would become problematic in so many ways.

162
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,750
This time, Misaka Misuzu-sama is a representative for the parents who are rooted to that movement.

163
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,570
So we decided to cut her short.

164
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,930
Will you participate as well, Accelerator?

165
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,590
What did you say?

166
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,070
We tried running this operation through Skill-Out, but...

167
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,740
Well they are really bad at what they do.

168
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,620
If you help out as an assist then...

169
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,430
I refuse.

170
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,990
My life is mine.

171
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,740
It doesn't matter what sort of expectations you have.

172
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,140
Is that so? Then please hurry up and return.

173
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,860
Well until then, we'll be keeping your powers to ourselves.

174
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,390
You tampered the electric-diode!

175
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,700
Then I'll have to excuse myself.

176
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,360
Goodnight, Accelerator!

177
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:58,040
Was it Misaka Misuzu...?

178
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,370
If I save her, the people at the top are going to be very angry, aren't they?

179
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,440
That bastard!

180
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,350
It's not time for that.

181
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,350
Let's save her from the most inconvenient situation, while I drench everything else in blood.

182
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:30,270
Who was it? Who forgot to cut off the security system?

183
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,780
For the time being, let's search for that woman.

184
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,280
What's going on here?

185
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:39,730
I did call Anti-Skill I suppose.

186
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,670
Those people are probably Skill-Out.

187
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,510
Skill-Out?

188
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,300
{They are a gathering of skill-outs and they are like a gang.}They're a gathering of level zeros, kind of like a gang.

189
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,960
Why are they aiming for me?

190
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,750
I don't know that, but...

191
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,130
Misaka-san, did you call your daughter?

192
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,480
She is one of the seven level five's in the Academy city

193
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,350
If you call her...

194
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,570
Wait, I don't want to call her.

195
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,570
If I get her involved in something again, I won't be able to face her anymore.

196
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,120
I understand.

197
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,750
Then I will suffice.

198
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,740
But I didn't call for that...

199
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,860
You still didn't find the woman, did you?

200
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:30,130
I am asking, where the hell is she?!

201
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:36,900
That Komaba, he just had to go and die like that!

202
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,750
What are we supposed to do?

203
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,150
Hamazura here.

204
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,880
Target located. We'll be dealing with these things on our own.

205
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,800
You guys...

206
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,000
Anti-Skill!

207
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,560
Ahh, those pieces of useless crap!

208
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,580
I will give you a chance to go to hell.

209
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,660
It's a good place, so you don't have to come back again.

210
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,750
Five? Everyone's holding a gun.

211
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,650
This is bullet-proof, right?

212
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,310
Is that woman an idiot?

213
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,990
If only I could get that gun in the back before they recover...

214
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,750
Hey! Don't joke ar-

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,870
You idiot!

216
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,260
Misaka-san, we're making a run for it.

217
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,760
Misaka-san! Hurry!

218
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,110
Interesting, you haven't given up yet!

219
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,060
You sure have some guts!

220
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,810
The back door?

221
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,990
For the time being, let's go to some place with a lot of people.

222
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,180
What is it with you?

223
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,190
Why does this have to happen at a time like this?

224
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,380
That woman over there was just a dummy and we were just set up?

225
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,610
Your job?

226
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,740
Komaba got himself killed, so then we had no choice but to cooperate with them.

227
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,010
Damn it, they were intending to let us die from the get go!

228
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,230
I came just because this person called me.

229
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:58,320
You mean, Hamazura Shiage's life will end here?

230
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,390
We got trapped in a big trap.

231
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,300
Or there was a mastermind behind all this.

232
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,690
Can't you even put on an act like that?

233
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,040
Well it's not good enough for me!

234
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,570
I need to beat the crap out of someone.

235
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,160
I won't be satisfied until I beat someone to death.

236
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,440
Stand back.

237
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,330
It means, {it is that isn't it?}

238
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,870
You aren't involved with them?

239
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:25,070
The thing is still effective?

240
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,970
If I take the corpse of the target!

241
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,350
Say that again, you bitch!

242
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,600
Don't give me that crap!

243
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,530
What do you take the life of a person to be?

244
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,370
We don't have a choice here.

245
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,290
If we don't do it, we, level zero, aren't going to survive.

246
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,710
Don't group me with you.

247
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,870
What?

248
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:57,750
Don't group us with assholes like you.

249
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,630
Come to think of it, you haven't used your ability even for a single moment.

250
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,730
If you want to count all the level zeros, there are thousands of them in Academy city.

251
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:12,060
They normally go to school, make friends, living a normal life!

252
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,910
Aren't you the one who's been making fun of the level zeros all along?

253
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,990
We both are the same.

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,910
We are not.

255
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,580
But the fact that I am a level zero is true.

256
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,740
I don't have any intention to drag people down and become a minus like you!

257
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,560
Minus?

258
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,570
We were Minuses?

259
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,280
People who have powers, but don't do anything. Compared to them, we are...

260
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,250
We, Skill-Out, are a hundred times better!

261
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,500
Then, did you extend your hand to the people who needed help?

262
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,750
If you had saved the people that needed to be saved rather than opposing the ability users...

263
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,470
You would have gained the acceptance from all of Academy city.

264
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,430
Shut up!

265
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:01,960
That's how Komaba Ritoku, the leader of Skill-Out, lived and he was killed.

266
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,530
He tried to protect us, the weak, from everyone else.

267
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,190
But that guy had something you didn't have.

268
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,680
So didn't he fight until the very end?

269
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,450
He fought to protect his comrades, rather than the weak.

270
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,620
Don't give me that crap.

271
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,840
You look down on us even though you don't have any power yourself?

272
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:28,330
People don't look down on you just because you don't have any powers.

273
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:34,760
Do something about that pathetic illusion of yours, you shit-bastard!

274
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:51,380
If I had to tell you the truth, I came to take back Mikoto-chan.

275
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:58,950
But you see, I am relieved. If kids like you keep protecting Mikoto-chan, nothing will go wrong.

276
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:01,280
You kids...?

277
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,080
Did you come to punish me or something after the top told you to?

278
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,360
No, we didn't.

279
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,290
About Misaka Misuzu, now she doesn't want to take her daughter out of Academy City.

280
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:22,650
That's why the assassination has been canceled.

281
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:25,270
Will the top settle down for such a vague conclusion?

282
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,340
They probably will.

283
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,030
Because his stupid Unabara tried his best all alone.

284
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:39,330
Well I think that young man will be able to keep his promise

285
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,590
in protecting that person and her world I care for.

286
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,920
I thought that I should work hard as well, but I did it a bit too much.

287
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,560
This guy has been answering like this for awhile now.

288
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,840
I think he played a very bad hand with the current situation.

289
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,470
Anyway, good work on overtime as well.

290
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,640
Damn you!

291
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:07,100
You can't outsmart them if you play by the book.

292
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,300
It just means that normally you can never beat them.

293
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,720
It seems you're very important to the top.

294
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,080
Let's move forward, Accelerator.

295
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,420
Interesting, but...

296
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,240
I'll just cut you up if you become a hindrance to me.

297
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,290
I like that attire of yours, kid!

298
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:26,590
Come with me.

299
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,340
We are about to retaliate against the top.

300
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,390
Seems like fun...

301
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,040
It's really fun to have a goal...

302
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,060
What is it with her?

303
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:47,990
Even though I sent a mail to her.

304
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,740
Why doesn't she answer?

305
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,070
No matter how much I do, the mountain of paperwork isn't ever going to be finished.

306
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,150
We have no choice, everyone has collapsed.

307
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,750
Please continue like this for the next three days, okay?

308
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,570
An emporium of intercepting weapons?

309
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,560
It says that, but it is just a demonstration of powered suits.

310
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
That is basically just an outfit, right?

311
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,480
That's too much you know!

312
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,030
This pudding... Even though it was bought from a convenient store, it's pretty good.

313
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,910
You'll get fat if you eat sweet things at night, you know!

314
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:47,680
Where is that person? Misaka Misaka tries asking.

315
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,210
He'll be back soon.

316
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,750
I want to meet him soon too, Misaka Misaka tries nodding.

317
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,430
Goodnight!

318
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,390
Touma!

319
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:17,570
You ran off again by yourself and got hurt!

320
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:21,760
I never understand what you are thinking from time to time.

321
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,110
Well, this time I had a bit of luck...

322
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:36,740
Such misfortune as always!
