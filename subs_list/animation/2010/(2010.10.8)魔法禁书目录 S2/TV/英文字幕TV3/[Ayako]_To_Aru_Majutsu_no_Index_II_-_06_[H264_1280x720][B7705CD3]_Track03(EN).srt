1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:05,850
Now for tomorrow's weather, September the 14th.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,820
It should be another sunny day throughout the country,

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,080
but the weather will gradually degrade starting from evening all the way into the night.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,530
Touma, Touma.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,160
What?

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,330
There are things that look like tree rings on the map.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,000
How do they figure out what the weather will be tomorrow from that?

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,620
Oh, those are isobar contour lines.

9
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,220
They probably make forecasts by looking at high- and low-pressure systems.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,840
Huh?

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,550
Does that mean the Academy City

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,090
has already made fortune-telling a reality through artificial systems?

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,950
Here, tasting time for you.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,310
It's still hot since I just made it.

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,190
Be careful when you're eating-

16
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:42,770
Huh?

17
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,700
Touma!!!

18
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,110
Unfair! That's unfair, Touma!

19
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,990
You always get pissed off when I steal food to eat.

20
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,790
You will eat all the food if I don't keep an eye on you.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,920
But Touma,

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,620
that weather forecast lady sometimes says things that are off.

23
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,290
Is that clumsiness her charm?

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,210
It just means that weather forecasts aren't absolute after all.

25
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,500
They were, until a while ago though...

26
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,640
Huh?

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,050
This is Shuttle 258.

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,280
We will hereby collect the remnants.

29
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,340
<b>Remnant</b>

30
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,090
Seriously, this is just unacceptable.
<b>Remnant</b>

31
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,240
<b>Remnant</b>

32
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,120
We can't keep having these schoolwide P.E. lessons so often because the Daihaseisai is coming up.

33
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,810
It can't be helped.

34
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,300
Our Tokiwadai Academy came in a humiliating second at last year's Daihaseisai,

35
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
so the people are desperate to win this year.

36
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,180
By the way Onee-sama, what are your plans after school today?

37
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,050
Why do you ask?

38
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,180
Oh well, I just wanted to go shopping once in a while with you...

39
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,600
and enjoy sweets like cake or something.

40
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,270
Since we keep missing each other these days.

41
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,870
Like me being busy with Judgment duties,

42
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,410
and you, Onee-sama, have been going around searching for some accessory... {line ends before shojiki}

43
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,510
Honestly, I'm a little lonely these days.

44
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,170
Kuroko?

45
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,790
Innocent...

46
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,380
I will show her my innocent face today.

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,840
And she would deny that, {need edit, remove tag after... marsd /lazy}

48
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:01,030
she will show her desire to be protective, and I will act completely babyish.

49
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,650
What sweets?

50
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,400
You keep having tons of that sweet stuff after your Judgment work or whatever

51
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,020
and that's giving you that large tummy-

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,580
Onee-sama~!

53
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,660
American Space Shuttle Launched Successfully

54
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,450
Onee-sama?

55
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,750
They are frequent these days, don't you think?

56
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,040
If I recall correctly, the French and Russians do as well.

57
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,850
Even the Spaniards launched one last week. {line starts from senshuu...}

58
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,730
Is something the matter, Onee-sama?

59
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,100
You don't seem to be in a very good mood.

60
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,480
Obviously.

61
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,950
Since I got to witness something as outrageous as receiving a fully naked dropkick out of nowhere.

62
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,940
Just finish your shopping already!

63
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,160
It's quite embarrassing to go along with your hobby, you know?

64
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,480
Onee-sama, you should use this chance to dress up appropriately as the Ace of Tokiwadai!

65
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,110
Like this,

66
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,900
and this...

67
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,010
and this too.

68
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,800
Breast pads?

69
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,930
Onee-sama is interested in this kind of stuff?!

70
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,590
Could it be, you're interested in a man?

71
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,370
I-It's not like that.

72
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,220
Of course not.

73
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:24,690
Onee-sama having such capricious thoughts for a man-

74
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,910
Come to think of it, on the last day of summer vacation...

75
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,980
No, that can't be, for Onee-sama out of all people...

76
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,160
Right, Onee-sama-

77
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,190
Wh-What is this seriously positive reaction that I can't even joke about?

78
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,820
Please don't say you are... you are in love with that ape...

79
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,120
Oh it's not like that. I don't have any interest in such things.

80
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,340
Since even if I put them on, it will be revealed when I undress.

81
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,870
Huh?

82
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,580
Onee-sama...

83
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,230
You have planned for the future that includes such activities?!

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,890
I mean it's not like that!

85
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,850
I'm talking about P.E.!

86
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,400
Like when we change for P.E....

87
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,420
Hey, your mobile is ringing.

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,900
Geez.

89
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,100
This isn't the time for that.

90
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,190
Hello?

91
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,560
Oh, is it Uiharu?

92
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,190
A robber?

93
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,690
You can leave that stuff to the Antiskills.

94
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,020
In the 23rd Academy District?

95
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,340
You mean that place for aerospace technology matters?

96
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,130
I'm sorry Onee-sama, I had you spend your time with me, but...

97
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,200
Oh, it's fine.

98
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,990
More importantly, you should return early today.

99
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,950
Since the weather might worsen tonight.

100
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,270
Yes, I see...

101
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,800
Oh, Shirai-san!

102
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,640
Are you the only one here, Uiharu?

103
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,180
Everyone happens to be out now.

104
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,730
Ah, I'll make some tea.

105
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:58,020
Thanks for that, but I don't need it right now.

106
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,360
No way...

107
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,120
I wanted to enjoy, even if it were a little, a taste of being an Ojou-sama!

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,120
I'll teach you about the proper manners of a lady on some other occasion.

109
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,070
For now, give me a summary about the incident.

110
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,840
Look at this.

111
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,510
What is this?

112
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,970
A transceiver instead of a mobile phone?

113
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,130
The victims are quite fishy too.

114
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,150
And then this is...

115
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,360
An emblem of the 23rd Academy District...

116
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,270
The model number was matched.

117
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:42,940
This suitcase is a special type, since it's completely airtight and can counter cosmic rays.

118
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,270
Don't tell me they were supposed to carry it into outer space.

119
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,990
It might be the other way around and they carried it back from outer space.

120
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,990
We might be able to solve this quicker if we can capture the thieves.

121
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,490
What about their escape route?

122
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,710
They abandoned their cars and went into the underground city.

123
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,160
Huh?

124
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,250
There's a traffic jam caused by a problem with the traffic lights{traffic signal problems}.

125
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,710
Things like that don't happen very often though...

126
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,510
Think of it as luck turning in our favor.

127
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,050
Huh?

128
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,220
Uiharu, you pursue those who escaped.

129
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,380
Hey, Shirai-san!

130
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,820
Hurry up!

131
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,870
Excuse me.

132
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,390
What?!

133
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,030
Teleportation?

134
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,420
I'm over here.

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,940
I'm from Judgment.

136
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,730
Do I need to explain why I'm here?

137
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,840
Damn it!

138
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,060
Such an obsolete{outdated} gun...{}

139
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,900
Are they from the Outside?

140
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,770
Hello, is it Uiharu?

141
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,280
Hey, Kuroko?

142
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,650
Onee-sama?

143
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,950
I have a favor to ask you.

144
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,910
Where are you now?

145
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,370
Oh, you're still in the middle of work.

146
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,370
I'm so sorry.

147
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,370
I must have bothered you.

148
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,200
Not really.

149
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,170
So what is the favor you wanted to ask me?

150
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,900
Well, I heard from a kouhai that we have a sudden room inspection.

151
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,920
I was hoping that you would hide my personal items.

152
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,620
You're still not home either, Onee-sama?

153
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,260
Oh, it's fine.

154
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,830
I'll ask someone else.

155
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,710
You should come home soon as well.

156
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,880
They say it might rain continuously starting tonight until tomorrow.

157
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,460
Goodbye.

158
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,740
Hey, Onee-sama!

159
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,930
I can't allow Onee-sama to ask a favor from someone else other than me!

160
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,040
It means I must{calls for me to} teleport to the student dorm immediately!

161
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,540
Huh?

162
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,970
Who are you?

163
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Teleportation?

164
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,480
Ah, so you've figured it out already?

165
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,550
A quick understanding, as expected from a similar ability user.{ability users of the same type.}{maybe something along the lines of being "similar ability users"}

166
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,320
My ability is Move Point.

167
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,270
Unlike a failure such as you, I don't need to touch the object in order to move it.

168
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,520
Well, isn't it wonderful?

169
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,300
Shirai Kuroko-san, from the Judgment Activities Branch 177.

170
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,650
Too easy!

171
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,430
I said, I'm not that easy!

172
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,790
Didn't I say I didn't need to touch the objects?

173
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,870
Too bad.

174
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:17,400
I didn't think she was the type of person who would get her kouhai involved in personal matters.

175
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,770
That Misaka Mikoto...

176
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,120
Huh?

177
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,970
Why would you mention Onee-sama's name here?

178
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,920
If you bought this you were ripped off.

179
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,230
Why would you mention Onee-sama's name here?

180
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:39,130
Oh, you didn't know?

181
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,840
Although it seems like she's not unknowingly exploiting you.{doesn't seem like you're unknowingly being exploited by her.}{}

182
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,780
The Railgun from Tokiwadai must be very noble.{}

183
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,850
Didn't you think it was a little too convenient?

184
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,560
That our men were caught in a traffic jam.

185
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,950
You surely know what ability the Ace of Tokiwadai controls.

186
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,940
What have you been talking about?

187
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,990
Remnant... Well, you probably don't know what I'm talking about.

188
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:08,450
Silico-random... Maybe that's too difficult too.{this silico random i think needs checking or...}

189
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,670
That's right.

190
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:12,530
You might understand if I call it the remains of the Tree Diagram.

191
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,970
What if I were talking about{If I meant} the central processor of the supercomputer that is considered as the brains of the Academy City,{}

192
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,150
which still holds enormous possibilities even after its destruction?{}

193
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,560
You're joking.

194
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,140
It should still be in satellite orbit.

195
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,810
Here's an attached report concerning its destruction.{report/photograph?}

196
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,910
Rare stuff, right?

197
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,910
The Tree Diagram was destroyed ages ago.

198
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,340
That's why people around the world are racing to get its remains, the Remnants.

199
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,790
It must be tough for Misaka Mikoto.

200
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:50,070
Thanks to someone destroying the Tree Diagram, her nightmare ended.{maybe tense problem}

201
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,760
But when they restore it, the experiments will repeat again.

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,550
I must say I might understand her desire to go on a futile resistance.{}

203
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,730
Experiment?

204
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,810
You still don't understand?

205
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,210
You really must be out of the picture.{not included in the issue}

206
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,130
August 21st.

207
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,960
Huh?

208
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,720
If you are able to reach up to that, I might be able to accept you as my friend.

209
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,110
*Splash*

210
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,620
Misaka, Misaka jumps into the bath.

211
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,810
And then with a feeling of openness goes on to kick the water.{the oppenness thingy}

212
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:32,100
Come on, even though you are so small, don't just feel some openness in this small bath-{}

213
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,630
How inconvenient is it not being able to use reflection ability?

214
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,370
Misaka, Misaka looks with pitying eyes.

215
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,020
Besides, how can ability users be in tears because of shampoo?

216
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,810
Misaka, Misaka is dumbfounded.

217
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,210
I'm not in tears!

218
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,170
And if I use your network to calculate, reflections-

219
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,730
Yomikawa!

220
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:56,780
Why do I have to take care of this bastard?!

221
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,850
There was no better choice.

222
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,610
Damn that Kikyou.

223
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,850
Forcing me to deal with needless troubles.

224
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,210
Well, they don't look like they're going to create too many problems after all.

225
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,300
Yomikawa!

226
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,100
I found out the name of the ability user you fought against.

227
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,960
Musujime Awaki, a Level 4, 2nd year student from Kirigaoka Girl's Academy.

228
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,840
About her ability, Move Point,

229
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,140
As you said in your report, {it's moving}she's capable of moving objects that are far away from her.{}

230
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,060
So it's a spatial movement from coordinate A to coordinate B.

231
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,590
Anything else you found out?

232
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:37,800
Umm... she's unable to interfere with ability users that have similar powers.

233
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:42,440
Also, she has a tendency to hesitate when teleporting herself.

234
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,290
Maybe it's because{It seems that is after} she suffered significant injuries two years ago.{}

235
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,730
Also, this is unconfirmed information, but...

236
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,580
She is one of the Guides.

237
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,690
Guides?

238
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,080
Into that doorless and windowless building{building that has no windows or doors}...

239
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,140
The HQ{headquarters} of the Chair of the Board of Directors to the Academy City Administration...

240
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,350
But that should have been an urban myth!

241
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,390
Are you okay, Shirai-san?

242
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,890
I'm fine, so continue with your report.

243
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,010
Okay.

244
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,100
According to Antiskill's information, the men in black that were being attacked were detained.{ to 249}

245
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,090
Their identities were carriers recruited by the 23th Academy District.

246
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,150
That was obtained from the Psychometrers reading their memory.

247
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,310
But they knew nothing about the contents of the case.

248
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:30,370
So the 23th Academy District was in the process{way} of transporting the contents of the case to a different research institution,

249
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,550
when Musujime's group intercepted them and had it taken{robbed} away.

250
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,890
Remnant... Tree Diagram...

251
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,570
It must be tough for Misaka Mikoto.

252
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:43,740
The nightmare should have ended.

253
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,450
More importantly, you should return early today.

254
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,980
Since the weather might worsen tonight.

255
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,150
Shirai-san?

256
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:58,680
Shouldn't we leave the matters of this incident in the hands of{to} the Antiskills?

257
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,120
Somehow it feels like it's gone beyond our capabilities or...

258
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,070
I'm hanging up.

259
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,080
Huh?

260
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,660
Kuroko?

261
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,320
What is it, Onee-sama?

262
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,080
Are you taking a bath?

263
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,630
At least turn the lights on if you've come home.

264
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,590
I-It's what they call saving energy.

265
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,650
I'm an earth friendly woman!

266
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,090
Oh, really?

267
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:36,350
But the Academy City mainly runs on wind power.

268
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,510
We don't need to worry about carbon dioxide emissions, right?

269
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:42,280
How mean of you, Onee-sama.

270
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:48,540
I was thinking of using this as an excuse to lure you into this {half-dark moody}semi-ominous atmosphere.{}

271
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,310
What the heck is that?

272
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,240
Where have you been until now, Onee-sama?

273
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,240
I would say, collecting the accessories I failed to buy.

274
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,580
It's quite difficult to find.

275
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,580
As for now, I came home to collect something I forgot.

276
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,190
I will be {going off now}heading out again.

277
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,760
I hope it doesn't rain.

278
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,110
Since the weather reports are unreliable these days.

279
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,990
That's right.

280
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,570
Thanks for worrying about me.

281
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,330
I'll try as much as I can to come home as soon as possible{not too late}.

282
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,460
Onee-sama...

283
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,790
August 21st,

284
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,450
Violent winds of unknown causes occurred on that night.{}

285
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:46,040
A rail yard was annihilated in the 17th Academy District.

286
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,410
And on the next day...

287
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,990
Uiharu,

288
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,330
Musujime's group has something to do with an organization outside the Academy City.

289
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,170
Can you simulate their escape route?

290
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,210
I'm sorry, Onee-sama.

291
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,750
You carry a darkness unimaginable to us.

292
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,510
Ouch...

293
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:29,560
And you are trying to {keep me away}prevent me from getting involved in it.

294
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,810
So I will apologize now,

295
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:39,280
for meddling despite my uselessness{while not being much use}, to put an end{in putting an end} to the nightmare Musujime talks about.

296
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,550
Onee-sama!

297
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:58,780
Come out, coward!

298
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,740
How long {will you keep hiding}do you plan to hide like that?!

299
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,100
Onee-sama...

300
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,800
You seem to be in quite a hurry today.

301
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,010
Are you that scared of having the Remnants rebuilt?

302
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,450
Or are you {rather }scared of the experiments that will resume?

303
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,510
Shut up!

304
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,520
You should leave those things as they are now.{that stuff as is.}

305
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,390
{Since they}They were made for the experiment anyway.

306
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:35,400
You should let them be destroyed, as they were intended to be.

307
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,660
Are you seriously saying that?

308
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,240
In the end, you are fighting for yourself, right?

309
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,200
Regret, grief and anger...

310
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,540
Just for small self-fulfillment like that.

311
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,390
That's right.

312
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,290
I'm annoyed.

313
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,250
So annoyed that my veins in my brain would rupture.

314
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,810
Did that idiot think I wouldn't notice?

315
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:06,970
{By h}Hearing such a fainthearted voice, it's just...horrible.{such horrible,}

316
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,950
Sure I am annoyed, at my too-complete-that-it's-stupid kouhai,

317
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,180
the scumbag in front of me,{the kouhai part i'm not sure}

318
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,680
and most importantly at myself that created this situation!

319
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,360
You're so kind that it's overly sweet.

320
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,120
If you kept grieving that you were a victim too, you didn't need to fight.

321
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,860
Anyway, I can't be caught here.

322
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,590
Whatever the method I use, I will have to escape.

323
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,170
You thought you would succeed?

324
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,340
I see what your plans are already!

325
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,290
Your shield is full of holes!{Such a screen like full of holes shield!}

326
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,510
Question:

327
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,100
How many unrelated commoners are included with them?

328
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,560
It seems that from here onwards, it's my turn.{show time.}

329
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,350
Now let's go{here I go}, Shirai Kuroko.

330
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,880
To make sure that you can return home{surely come back home},

331
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,640
go into the deepest part of the battlefield.

332
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,050
If that's true, it must be rushed.

333
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,340
Misaka kicks up the priority level within herself.

334
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,560
Although its curfew time already, I feel there's no time to waste...

335
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,770
Misaka frantically uses many emergency excuses for herself.{}

336
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,230
That even at this very moment, when things are turning for the worse,

337
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,180
Misaka is...
