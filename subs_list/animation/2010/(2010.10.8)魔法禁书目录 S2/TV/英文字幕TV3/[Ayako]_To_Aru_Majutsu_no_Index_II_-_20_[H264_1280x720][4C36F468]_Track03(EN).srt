1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,040
Hound Dog's Kihara Amata attacked Accelerator.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,400
Furthermore, apparently his objective is to capture Last Order.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,890
In order to help Last Order escape, Accelerator didn't have a chance to retaliate.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:11,890
At that time...

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,740
What are you doing over there?

6
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:55,090
<b>Hound Dog</b>

7
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,250
What should we do?

8
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,190
What do you mean? We can only back down, right?

9
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:25,020
Drive, if you don't get to the hospital quickly, it will be too late for you.

10
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,630
What are you doing? Shoot quickly!

11
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,390
Okay.

12
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Don't make a fuss.

13
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,550
Come on, buckle up.

14
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,030
It's not only you who doesn't have much time left.

15
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,970
Where are you headed?

16
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,440
To a nice doctor that I know.

17
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,440
That, that, bring that out!

18
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,630
You're very naive.

19
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,140
If you use a car, then you can't control the wind.

20
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,240
Are you trying to provoke me to attack?

21
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,400
Good bye, you damn kid.

22
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,210
Jeez...

23
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,980
It's a nice city, isn't it?

24
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,550
Although I thought that it would get swiftly corrupted.

25
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,600
Who are you?

26
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,310
Killing is my profession.

27
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,830
Kill her.

28
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,610
So you have no intention to fight, right?

29
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,480
It's just that if I go straight for the target, it'll be more efficient.

30
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,240
Well then, it seems I have been quite underestimated.

31
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,210
Will you people actually be of any use?

32
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,970
I was attacked by those people, says Misaka Misaka as she tries to tell the truth.

33
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,210
But does it mean that this was done by your acquaintance?

34
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,710
This may not be it.

35
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:22,300
Although that person is short-tempered and quick to fight, I find it hard to believe that he did this.

36
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,770
Says Misaka {as }Misaka tries to come up with a simple surmisable answer.

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,680
Anyway, I have to report this.

38
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:29,270
{ignore}

39
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,140
Those guys are here!

40
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,580
{ignore}

41
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,370
Informs Misaka Misaka while hiding behind the rubble of the car.

42
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,740
Those guys?

43
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,720
Oh look, what's this?

44
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,810
That's an olfactory sensor.

45
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,650
We use this to stalk the target.

46
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,340
In other words, it's a tool for the police.

47
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,800
But really, is this lull environment Kihara's doing?

48
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,840
Why are you in such a place?

49
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,130
I came to return something that I borrowed.

50
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,470
Here look! This state of the art, everyday item.

51
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,480
Are you an idiot?

52
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
This can't be used.

53
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:43,320
That worthless, worthless ugly duckling turned out to be an elegant swan.

54
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,760
The end.

55
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,100
Hey, what does elegant mean?

56
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,340
The story of the ugly duckling isn't like that.

57
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,660
Then what is it like?

58
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,380
What was it again?

59
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,230
If I recall correctly, according to what the kid said,

60
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,170
the swan was baffled by the fact that it wasn't wanted in the circle of ducklings.{tl check}

61
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,880
But it was truly happy.

62
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,800
By 'that kid', were you referring to that lost kid that you were searching for the other time?

63
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,460
To be correct, I'm still searching for her at the moment.

64
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,360
You got separated from her again?

65
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,730
Yeah, that's right. That's why we're going to split paths here.

66
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,310
I will search for her, too!

67
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,570
After all, I can understand your plight.

68
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,740
I think Touma would also have said the same thing.

69
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,910
Stop around here.

70
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,980
There's a big hospital nearby.

71
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,250
Head over there and look for a doctor whose face resembles that of a frog.

72
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:49,260
If you meet the doctor, tell him to prepare some electrode batteries for the Misaka Network.

73
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,210
Then connect it.

74
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:55,640
I get it, electrode batteries for the Misaka Network, right?

75
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,520
Wait for me, okay?

76
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,850
Yeah.

77
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,100
You better wait for me until I get back from there.

78
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,650
I got it, now just go.

79
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,050
Start the car.

80
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,740
You still won't let me go?

81
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,730
Life or death, it's up to you.

82
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,380
Are you still alive, Last Order?

83
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,390
It's no good, it's locked.

84
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,060
If you mean this, I might be able to unlock it.

85
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,550
Anyway, we should {go}head to a crowded place for now.

86
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,750
I'm sure those guys don't want to cause a ruckus.

87
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,320
Can we really help that person like this?

88
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,920
Asks Misaka Misaka as she laments over her lack of strength.

89
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,020
No clue.

90
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,510
But...

91
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:17,970
If we don't survive here, we definitely won't be able to.

92
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,300
If you want to save him, first we need to make sure that we don't die.

93
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,590
Yes, says Misaka Misaka as she nods her head.

94
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,300
Well then, let's go.

95
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,950
What's happening?

96
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,080
Anyway, let's go outsi-!

97
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,470
What business do you have at this time?

98
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,930
There's trouble, big trouble.

99
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,940
I've heard a brief overview of the situation from the Misaka sisters.

100
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,050
They seem to have shared their information by using the electrical network.

101
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,260
Then that makes things easier.

102
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,760
What happened to that brat?

103
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:26,250
It seems like they're being pursued by another unit of the Hound Dog.

104
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,930
It looks like she's with another civilian who happened to be walking by.

105
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,710
Tch, and her location?

106
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,380
It seems she does not know.

107
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,900
Did another brat donning clerical robes come?

108
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,360
Why does she know about the situation?

109
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,620
That's none of your concern.

110
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:47,070
Anyway, stall her there.

111
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,340
My, my, so how far are you willing to go?

112
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,670
I will kill Kihara and destroy Hound Dog.

113
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,280
And then, I will try to save that brat unharmed.

114
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,720
That's impossible.

115
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,340
In this situation, you're trying to account for too many moving targets.

116
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,580
And you definitely cannot achieve that!

117
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Don't give me that crap!

118
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,550
No matter-

119
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,040
I've seen a hell of a lot worse than yours.

120
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,620
That's why there are things I can say.

121
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,800
Accelerator, you shouldn't aim for too many unnecessary objectives,

122
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,550
just focus on saving Last Order's life instead.

123
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,900
If you bring her back to me alive, I can definitely heal her.

124
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,240
To be able to fulfill this expectation is what it means to be a doctor.

125
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,640
That's just fine, isn't it?

126
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,240
God's Right Seat, eh?

127
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,620
To think that they would go this far...

128
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,470
This is Yomikawa.

129
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,720
I want some specifics on Call 334.

130
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,100
Such a...

131
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,870
What... is this?

132
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:34,980
The third city railway, re-manufacturing processing plant?

133
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,490
The target's scent continues over there.

134
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,230
First of all, we're not mistaken, right?

135
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,320
If you want to return home safely, just stay put.

136
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,010
Detergent, it's this right?

137
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,540
I better remove my scent quickly and make my way out of here.

138
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,040
Damn it, they're much faster than I expected.

139
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,480
They only have small ones?

140
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,120
Onee-sama!

141
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,290
What is it, Kuroko?

142
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,350
I can't return because of Judgment work.

143
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:23,250
I'd like you to contact that annoying dorm manager.

144
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,840
Erm, I'm in the convenience store right now.

145
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
Ehh?!

146
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,890
To think that even Onee-sama is out.

147
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,400
Now I have to hand in an explanation without backtalk it seems...

148
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,820
Why did Misaka-san have a fiery tirade today?

149
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:46,660
Could it be... Onee-sama is having a date-night with that rowdy man right now?

150
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,670
Curse you!

151
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,280
That bastard! Enjoying the dripping of the rain was yet another smart choice!

152
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,230
This can't be tolerated any longer.

153
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:57,630
To protect Onee-sama's virginity is my, Shirai Kuroko's duty!

154
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:58,660
You shouldn't.

155
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,230
Look, these office documents and accounts aren't finishing up at all.

156
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,080
What kind of situation is this?

157
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,700
Why aren't they coming after us?

158
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,210
Hi!

159
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,480
Were you surprised?

160
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,530
Don't be afraid and come out.

161
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,130
I also have my circumstances here.

162
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,400
If you don't properly listen to what I say,

163
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,030
I will turn you into a fine mesh of pulp.

164
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,080
Who are you?!

165
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,560
One of the God's Seats, Vento the Front.

166
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,430
Target confirmed.

167
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:50,600
As such, I'm going to destroy you quickly, Kamijou Touma!

168
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,820
Rod, how's the olfactory sensor?

169
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,590
Wait, it's finishing up.

170
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:29,510
You don't have to be nervous.

171
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,920
You won't even have time to feel the pain.

172
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,260
Hide, Last Order!

173
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:43,570
Just as expected of the legendary right hand.

174
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:46,030
You sure did a good job of keeping up!

175
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,490
From above?

176
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,410
It's so fun!

177
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,950
I get it! I get it.

178
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:58,160
So that right hand, as it was reported, has extraordinary powers.

179
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,450
We've clashed a few times here and there, but you {didn't ask for my real name at all.} never asked for my real name.

180
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,160
Real name?

181
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,330
But with this, he doesn't really understand.

182
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,750
Okay, let's try it out.

183
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,850
Damn you!

184
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,910
So that's how it is.

185
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:20,970
Sorry, it seems that killing you before you have time to sense the pain is impossible.

186
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:24,680
That's why, if you want to be happy, awaken as a masochist or something.

187
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,920
Since earlier, the movements of the hammer and the direction of attack have become different.

188
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,940
Could it be...? Is it that cross?

189
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,220
Oh no! You found out!

190
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,350
Well, it started to become a little troublesome.

191
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,450
Run away!

192
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,490
Go!

193
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,730
Please go get help.

194
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,940
Don't look back!

195
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:06,940
You sure are cruel to make a small girl like that run through such darkness.

196
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,100
Isn't it better for both of you to be killed together?

197
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,150
If I go back for her later, there won't be any problem.

198
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,570
That's why I won't die.

199
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,410
Ah, how funny.

200
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:21,570
But, but, if I turn your internal organs into a fleshy juice, will you still be able to say that?

201
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:25,530
Hey, since my target is you.

202
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:29,100
If you don't run, it will be a great help to me.

203
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,390
It's a joke.

204
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,960
Joke?

205
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,600
Yes, it is.

206
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,060
You won't die, will you?

207
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:01,010
My bad, who do you think you're making your enemy?

208
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,870
You're kind.

209
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:16,100
Is it really OK for you to not worry about yourself?

210
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,000
You bastard.

211
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,090
What good will getting worked up do at this point in time?

212
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:26,010
You know what's happening in Academy City right now, don't you?

213
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,770
Realize your own value.

214
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:34,620
My target is Kamijou Touma. Everyone else is just an extra.

215
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,070
Even the Index Librorum Prohibitorum is nothing compared to you.

216
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,840
As you are now, you are undoubtedly the Roman Catholic Church's enemy.

217
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,620
And we will use any means to destroy our enemies.

218
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,440
Even if we have to destroy a country like Japan.

219
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,120
As depicted by this signed form by the Roman Catholic Church.

220
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,330
What's the meaning of this?

221
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,910
Does it seem like a joke to you?

222
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,840
In that case, I will kill everyone within this store!

223
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,300
Stop it.

224
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,300
Rot to death!

225
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:10,900
This is Deiha, reporting the situation.

226
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,740
Over.

227
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,080
Damn it.

228
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,050
Seriously?

229
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,560
Shit.

230
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,620
What's this?

231
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,200
Is it some magical effect?

232
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,110
Shirai-san, which lunchbox do you want?

233
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,460
Chinese Udon or Kobata Bentou?

234
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,510
Even now that rowdy bastard and Onee-sama are in the night city...

235

Even now that rowdy bastard and Onee-sama are in the night city...

236
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,050
It's time for the Ikinori variety show.

237
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,340
TV TV.

238
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,290
Chinese!

239
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,210
* Disturbances due to intruders in academy city
* The arrest of the great scam
* Report on the movie Hitotsu Hajime-san is starring in
* Papisshi the first 180kg forerunner
* Weather report

240
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,340
Currently in Academy City, there appears to be some disturbances due to intruders.

241
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,070
Currently in Academy City, there appears to be some disturbances due to intruders.

242
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,140
In addition, more casualties are occurring all over Academy City.

Clamor due to intruders within academy city
In addition, more casualties are occurring all over Academy City.

244
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,090
Ah, there's footage.
Clamor due to intruders within academy city

245
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:27,640
Clamor due to intruders within academy city

246
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,600
Please wait for awhile

247
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,120
Did a report about that footage reach here?

248
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,500
But if there's really only one person overwhelming the Anti-Skill,

249
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,960
that intruder must be quite dangerous.

250
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,010
If it's really that bad, the Anti-Skill would call for backup.

251
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,330
Until then, we should do as much paperwork as we...

252
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,050
Uiharu?

253
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,210
With this, I should have got rid of those guys' olfactory sensors.

254
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,190
Is that it?

255
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,520
Save me!

256
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,960
Please protect me!

257
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,690
Take this!

258
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,230
I'm saved!

259
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,040
If you touch me, your relationship with that damn brat, which you really wanted to protect, will be over!

260
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,880
W-What?

261
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,840
Wait! Wait, Accelerator!

262
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,000
Save me-!

263
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,120
Get away from that person.

264
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,330
What a surreal scene.

265
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,450
I see.

266
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,450
So Academy City was meant to be attacked like this as well.

267
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,880
Stabbing through any human that's standing still, one by one.

268
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,330
This is bad.

269
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,390
Aiho!

270
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,790
The evidence from the crime scene in school zone 5 matches the database.

271
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:48,530
Please treat this person as a primary suspect in an attempted murder.

Amidst the confusion in Academy City, Accelerator wanders around.

276

And also, there are enormous wings dancing in the sky.

277
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,440
Don't tell me those are...
