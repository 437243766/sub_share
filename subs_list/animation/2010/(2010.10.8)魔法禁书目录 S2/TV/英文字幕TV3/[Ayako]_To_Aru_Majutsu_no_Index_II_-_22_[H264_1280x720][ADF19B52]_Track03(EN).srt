00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,270
<b>Divine Punishment Spell</b>

2
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,790
Esper mode has only 60 seconds left.
<b>Divine Punishment Spell</b>

3
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,460
Esper mode has only 60 seconds left.

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,520
But at least, if I kill this one, everything will end.

5
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,980
I won't go back to the path of light anymore.

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,600
Then, let's think about going down to hell with Kihara!

7
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,780
This bastardous piece of shit!

8
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,550
What kind of foolish face are you making while standing in front of me!?

9
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,410
Listen up kid!

10
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,900
Didn't you come to save that brat?

11
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,410
Damn shit holes!

12
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,910
Oh, by the way, do you think of yourself as someone who's awesome and cool?

13
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:27,680
Facing evil alone by yourself, trying to save a pathetic kidnapped brat...

14
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:33,360
Did you think everything in your life would be forgiven after doing all this?

15
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,040
You will always be covered in mud!

16
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,940
You shit face!

17
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,490
I understand that much...

18
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,990
That I will always be covered in mud... But on top of that, the thing that I am searching for isn't there.

19
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:51,500
If it is hell, then we both can go there alone.

20
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,700
Don't drag that brat over there!

21
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,390
You fucking shit face!

22
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,160
You have been very annoying for quite some time!

23
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,290
Hanging your disgusting right arm like that...

24
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,730
And saving such a sickening mockery of an angel.

25
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:51,190
How far do you think you are going to make me laugh until you're satisfied?

26
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,640
Don't give me that crap, you whore!

27
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,440
Do you think that this world only needs your approval?

28
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,580
Why don't you guys ever think about accepting others rather than yourself?

29
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,080
I hate science,

30
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,870
I despise science.

31
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,770
I hate the science that turned me into this!

32
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:23,380
The one who murdered my brother... That science is what I despise!

33
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,130
A person?

34
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,890
Wait!

35
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,020
What?

36
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,890
Kazakiri!

37
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,220
That's what science is all about.

38
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,010
You are one of them as well!

39
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,880
Don't you ever think that it's disgusting?

40
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,670
Heh, once the battery dies, you're nothing but a useless piece of trash.

41
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,710
{missing}

42
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,340
You bitch!

43
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,960
What the...?

44
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,870
Kazakiri!

45
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,020
You hypocrite!

46
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:14,890
What the hell are you doing?

47
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:22,080
This is great!

48
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,700
I have been saying 'misfortune', 'misfortune' all this time.

49
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,430
But if it's this much, then it's a blessing, isn't it?

50
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,500
What is it? What are you talking about?

51
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,350
Just you wait, Kazakiri!

52
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,760
Index is moving in order to save you!

53
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,970
After all, she is your friend.

54
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,530
She will live up to your expectations.

55
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,910
Rest assured. Until that time, I will certainly stop her no matter what!

56
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,670
Don't be screwing with me, you crippled piece of shit!

57
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,820
Shit!

58
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,430
You fucking brat!

59
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,460
Are you shitting me?!

60
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,330
Shit, let me go! Damn!

61
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,020
I see, since he can't use his abilities,

62
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,800
that means my protection is rendered ineffective.

63
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:02,430
Damn, it won't suffice to just kill this brat!

64
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,180
It would just mean that he'll lose the purpose to die.

65
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
What should I do for that purpose?

66
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,060
Look at this. This is the original script to cure the virus in that brat's brain.

67
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,730
Without this, that brat cannot be saved at all!

68
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,880
Serves you right! You fucking brat!

69
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:38,980
I completely destroyed everything that you held precious!

70
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,960
You... can't take anything back now.

71
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,850
Come now, it is your turn!

72
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:53,500
Whether if heaven exists or not, why don't you think about something pathetic just like that!

73
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,750
There she is!

74
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,400
It's that child!

75
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,200
I can do this... She dodged her hammer to avoid my right hand.

76
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,760
In other words, I can eliminate it with this!

77
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,180
If that is the case...

78
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,600
I guess there isn't any advantage for me getting close to you.

79
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,080
If I don't have to worry about my surroundings, then I can go all out against you.

80
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,780
It's as if you're having that monster give you a helping hand.

81
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,030
Not "as if". She actually <i>is</i> helping me!

82
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,290
What the hell you're saying?!

83
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,400
That is your limit!

84
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,100
Do not underestimate God's Right Seat!

85
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,790
Damn...

86
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,650
Vento!

87
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,600
Damn, what's up with you and saying things in such a stupid manner!

88
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Weren't you science freaks the ones who set this up?

89
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,620
Along with the angel's appearance, you guys somehow entirely forced her ability throughout.

90
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:51,250
In other words, you've been causing an imperfect circulation of magical power.

91
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,720
That Aleister, thinking up this perverted plan!

92
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,090
You idiot, why would there be a reason for all that fighting?

93
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,250
Don't say such idiotic stuff!

94
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,530
Damn, I wasn't able to dodge it!

95
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,550
Don't you need help?

96
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:20,030
Sorry, but I can't allow this to go on any longer! I will take you to the hospital immediately.

97
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,270
Shut up! I am not entrusting myself to science for the second time!

98
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,370
My brother got killed by science.

99
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,130
What?

100
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,240
The attraction of an amusement park test run.

101
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,800
I was told that there was no problem "scientifically".

102
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,350
There were countless safety devices, a fully automatic speed control program.

103
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,960
Only those reliable words were lined up there...

104
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,000
They did not come up to be of any use in reality!

105
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,540
You...

106
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,490
And yes, after that, when we were carried to the hospital...

107
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,700
They failed to prepare a blood transfusion for two people!

108
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,350
The doctor said that he could only save the life of one person.

109
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:07,020
My brother said, please save my sister.

110
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,510
And so, I was the only one who survived.

111
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,930
Are you surprised?

112
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,530
A member of God's Right Seat fighting on such a reason!

113
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,180
But you know, I want to destroy the science side even if I have to use the Right Seat of God as a means to do so.

114
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,440
The science stole our ways.

115
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,140
And also, it made a mockery of the Bible which gave us a savior for our lives.

116
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,920
This is what science is all about.

117
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,570
It isn't anything but a bother to people.

118
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,570
That's why I hate and detest science.

119
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:47,410
If science is such a cold thing, then I will destroy it and build order,

120
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,520
which would be much warmer for the world!

121
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,960
That is my duty towards my little brother whose future was stopped.

122
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,820
Don't speak such crap!

123
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,080
What?

124
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,680
What do you mean "science killed your brother"?

125
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,520
That doctor didn't want to let anyone die to start with.

126
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,820
It's obvious he wanted to save you both!

127
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,820
And the accident that occurred at the attraction is the same as well.

128
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,010
It's not like they were operating it to hurt people.

129
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,190
They wanted to create smiles on people.

130
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,770
Shut up!

131
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,770
Your brother, on top of knowing the situation he was in,

132
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,580
still wanted to save you, right?

133
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,580
Someone like that, do you think he asked you to take revenge against science?

134
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,860
He was the one that wished for your happiness above any other!

135
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,910
I said shut up!

136
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,210
Is there any value in the words of a child on the verge of death?

137
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,070
If there was not enough blood, then they should have given them to my little brother.

138
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,900
Then, it would have been absolutely fine to have used my blood.

139
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,200
There was a value!

140
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,020
If it wasn't for your brother's decision, you wouldn't be living up to this very moment.

141
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,480
Then, that means there was a value!

142
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:08,410
That value, aren't you the one who should be holding it dear more than anyone else?

143
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,270
How stupid!

144
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,340
Do you think those stupid words will comfort me?

145
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,340
I ended that little child's future!

146
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:18,570
A person with very similar circumstances as you wouldn't say what you just said!

147
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,900
I can't do that and that is why I am against you.

148
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,620
You are wrong with that way of living.

149
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,290
At that time, your brother did the greatest thing on earth.

150
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:32,240
Are you going to dirty his effort?

151
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,240
Are you going to keep saying that he died hating science and ruin what he did?

152
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,360
You make me laugh!

153
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:45,290
This is the path that I chose.

154
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:52,490
It won't be so easy to change that for someone like you who just heard my story!

155
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,440
The Academy city, which is garnishing Kazakiri in that horrible appearance,

156
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,980
Vento who has been taken away by the feelings of hatred towards science,

157
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,510
I will surely wipe out those illusions!

158
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,280
This probably won't compare to what your brother did,

159
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,550
but I will save you even for a little bit.

160
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,730
Go start over from the beginning!

161
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,040
You big idiot!

162
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,900
The boy from that time...

163
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:51,660
Is there a connection between these people and the current situation?

164
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
Hey!

165
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,290
What? I am in the middle of work here.

166
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,320
Hey, stay away.

167
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,190
Don't do whatever you like.

168
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,240
As expected, this little girl is the core to everything.

169
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,630
The basis is in the angel's structure.

170
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:19,540
It's a creation from a silhouette where the formless Telesma is forced into the image of a person.

171
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:23,660
But if it's only me, I don't know what to do from here.

172
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,660
Short hair, I have a question!

173
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,030
Call me Mikoto-sama!

174
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,310
So, what is your question?

175
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,120
What is the electronic network that uses brain waves?

176
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:45,810
What? Errm... Those electric espers use the identical brain waves to construct an electronic network, or something like that.

177
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,980
Well, the thing that is encircling Academy city,

178
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,930
the AIM dispersion field, what does it mean?

179
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,410
It's a field involuntarily created by espers when they subconsciously emit their powers.

180
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:03,620
In other words, by restraining the mind of this girl who is in control of the special power,

181
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:09,780
which encircles Academy City, the angel is created.

182
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,020
If that is so, then I just need to untie the knot in this girl's brain.

183
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,270
But then, how to make this idea into a concrete measure?

184
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,460
A song!

185
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,800
It can convey the simplest thought very easily.

186
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,640
Using rhythm, one can stir different emotions in someone.

187
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,610
Wait. How can things work out with such an analogue way like that?

188
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:40,590
It can. Our prayers will reach them and we can save everyone with our prayers.

189
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,610
This child... Hyouka too... Academy city too...

190
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,770
What is it with this bastard?

191
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,800
Moving all of a sudden like this!

192
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,160
Ki...hara...

193
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,160
Kihara!!!

194
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,880
Huh, interesting.

195
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:44,850
That's right, isn't it? If you easily got knocked down, it'd be boring.

196
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,290
Thanks for giving me a big service of sushi, Accelerator!

197
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,780
Now, I am getting pissed thanks to you.

198
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,710
Before killing you, I'll beat you down for good with my fists!

199
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,660
Doesn't ring a bell, little kid!

200
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,910
Okay, that's the way to go!

201
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,960
I think I'll make things a bit more interesting.

202
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,500
Give me more of your motivation!

203
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:41,320
How did you... What are those? Those pitch black wings on your back?

204
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,860
This bastard... What type of power is he yielding?

205
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:50,700
Did he get a new control area expansion? Damn this brat!

206
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,790
What kind of numerals did he put in his personal reality?

207
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,390
Could it be... That angel or something?

208
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,170
The true character of that power is...

209
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:05,340
No... didn't you already notice?

210
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,650
You monster!

211
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,600
<b>Die</b>

212
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,710
What about Kazakiri?

213
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,480
Kazakiri!

214
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,290
If I touch Kazakiri now, I might even erase her whole self.

215
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,120
Who are you?

216
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:24,710
Excuse me.

217
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,320
I had business with this girl.

218
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,960
I said who are you?

219
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:35,730
Aqua of the Back. I am like Vento, a member of God's Right Seat.

220
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,120
You don't need to worry.

221
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,400
This is all for today. We will pull back.

222
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,210
Let go of Vento!

223
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:51,840
Hmm... To let Vento off here means that the science side will surely execute her.

224
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,810
I will give that thing to you.

225
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,070
It has already been destroyed by your right hand.

226
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,510
It is just garbage now.

227
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:04,280
Vento won't be able to use Divine Punishment anymore.

228
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,360
The people who were under its charm should start recovering right away.

229
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,460
With that, be at ease that you can protect the peace of the Academy city.

230
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,990
Can I be satisfied with only that?

231
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,670
I will tell you only one thing...

232
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,780
I am a Saint.

233
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:25,690
If you choose to fight me, you will end up shortening your life span.

234
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,760
Hey, wait!
