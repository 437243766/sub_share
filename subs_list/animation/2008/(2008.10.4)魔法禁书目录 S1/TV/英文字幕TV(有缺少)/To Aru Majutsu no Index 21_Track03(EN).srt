1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,900
Hey, Touma.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,830
Are you really going to school starting today?

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:14,840
Oh, that's right.

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,950
You're going to be home alone from now on.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,050
I didn't say that I'd be lonely or that I don't like being alone; it's not like that!

6
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,040
We need to take the time and actually think about what to do about this.

7
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,040
But, sorry, be home alone for today.

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,340
Touma, will you come home as soon as you can?

9
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,660
I guess.

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,640
Let's go hang out somewhere once I get back.

11
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,700
OK!

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,580
I'll be going then.

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,600
Yeah, have a good day.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,820
Well, what are we going to play today?

15
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,040
Huh?

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,410
Touma, what about my lunch?

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,020
What should I do...

18
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,170
This is a huge crisis I have yet to face...

19
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,990
Shocker...

20
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,730
Yo.

21
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,320
All fired up already, eh?

22
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,890
You sure seem relaxed.

23
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,400
Well yeah...

24
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,500
So much has happened, and my body's tired.

25
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,420
W-What?!

26
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,890
Was yesterday's "boyfriend" game that tiring for you?

27
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,880
Hey, that's not the only factor.

28
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,010
Not the only...

29
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,850
Are you saying... you're doing that kind of thing for other girls, too?!

30
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,200
...You're the only one who would calmly ask me
to do such embarrassing things, okay?!

31
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,090
You think I asked you calmly?!

32
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,570
Even for me, I didn't know what to do...

33
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,910
...and since I couldn't come up with any other solution...

34
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,950
...I swallowed the embarrassment and...

35
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,660
...begged you to do it!

36
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,630
Uhh, yeah, sure, uh huh, it's just like you say.

37
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,560
Hey, wait!

38
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,600
Listen to me seriously!

39
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,310
September 1st.

40
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,710
The first day of the second semester.

41
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,670
But, having lost my memories during summer vacation,

42
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,130
I have the nervous feeling
transfer students have on the first day.

43
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:08,650
Komoe-sensei?

44
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,230
...Her feet can reach the brakes?

45
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:20,070
I can drive even if my feet can't reach the brakes!

46
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,120
Gosh!

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,720
Sensei doesn't remember raising you in such a bad manner, Kamijyo-chan!

48
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,580
Sensei... that's not a pop quiz, is it?

49
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,220
Sensei wouldn't do something to her own students that she, herself, hated.

50
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,960
A friend requested that I gather some data.

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,080
It's a white paper on AIM dispersion field.

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,940
What's umm...

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,040
"An Involuntary Movement",

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,960
in other words, lack of self-consciousness.

55
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:57,100
Basically, it's when an esper emits
a field of power like the sun emitting light.

56
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,330
Granted, these are so weak that they can't even be measured.

57
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,220
Then, if there was an esper that could detect those,

58
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,990
they can say "Hey! There's a presence of an esper nearby" or something?

59
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,230
Yes!

60
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,370
And further down the line, they might even be able to distinguish the type or magnitude of the power, too.

61
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,670
"Mmm... his Power Level is 70000!"

62
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,630
...something like that,

63
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,500
and basically, there are people who devote their passion to that kind of research.

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,660
Thanks for bringing me here every time.

65
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,860
Hey, what's going on?

66
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,590
Allowing a magician to break into this city so easily.

67
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,110
It doesn't matter.

68
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,740
I am tracing the location of the intruder as we speak.

69
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,720
Shelley Cromwell.

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,110
She's not a vagrant magician, but a member of the English Purist Church, Necessarius.

71
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,960
If she's taken down without care, then the status quo between the Church and Academy City will be ruptured.

72
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,570
For both "neighbor loving" sides
to be breathing down each other's throats...

73
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,220
Anyway, have me take out Shelley.

74
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,760
If a magician takes out a magician,
then the commotion will be smaller.

75
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,890
There is no need for you to do anything.

76
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,890
Don't tell me... you want to have Kamijyo Touma handle this again?!

77
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,680
It can shorten the time between Plan 2082 and Plan 2377.

78
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,070
Is that the control theory of the Imaginary Number Sector - Five Elements Institution?

79
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,350
For it is a restive horse that could rip apart the entire world,

80
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,590
and it would be best to have a
firm grip of the reins before it's too late.

81
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,330
Huh?

82
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,540
What's up, Kami-yan?

83
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,900
Where's Tsuchimikado?

84
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,670
Yeah, we haven't seen him yet, huh?

85
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,690
Maybe he didn't finish his homework.

86
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,810
Hey, look at me,

87
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:52,930
I purposely left them on the backburner just so that Komoe-sensei could give me a scolding!

88
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,140
Hey now...

89
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,940
Okay children, time to begin homeroom.

90
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,230
Before the starting ceremony, I have big news for you all.

91
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,230
And wow, we have a new transfer student in our class today.

92
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,100
Oh, it's a girl, by the way.

93
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,360
Congratulations, goons!

94
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,880
Better luck next time, kitties.

95
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay, transfer student, come on in!

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,920
Index?!

97
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,530
Ah, it's Touma!

98
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,920
This was your "school" after all!

99
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,580
Where did you come from?!

100
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,930
You're not the transfer student!

101
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,920
Come on, get out, get out.

102
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,610
Sister-chan, what are you doing here?

103
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,810
Here.

104
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,320
Use this and get a taxi to go straight home.

105
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,630
And don't follow strangers, okay?

106
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:57,830
By the way, the real transfer student is me...

107
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,500
...Himegami Aisa.

108
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,670
I'm hungry...

109
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,390
Mmm, I've heard of this.

110
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,270
Coupons that can be exchanged for food come out from them.

111
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,130
Touma makes fun of me and calls me an "antique",

112
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,670
but this is a piece of cake.

113
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,210
Put in the money.

114
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,240
And just press the button.

115
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,960
Huh?

116
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,020
Where's the button?

117
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,330
There's no button!

118
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,500
What should I do?

119
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,920
The money got eaten, too!

120
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,920
Umm...

121
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,920
You need to press the button.

122
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,240
There's no button anywhere.

123
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,780
Well, just touch the monitor.

124
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,440
But I can't touch the people inside the TV.

125
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,110
This TV is linked with the inside, huh?!

126
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,620
No, umm...

127
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,660
Thank you!

128
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,690
What's your name?

129
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm Kazakiri Hyouka.

130
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,100
And then, you know?

131
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,410
I called Touma's name,

132
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,570
but not only did he not answer me,
he turned his eyes somewhere else!

133
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:25,210
Well, school's not a place for outsiders to come.

134
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,720
But, Hyouka, so are you...

135
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,090
I'm a transfer student.

136
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,690
I'm going to become a transfer student, too, then!

137
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,440
Umm...

138
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,590
There's no way I'm going back home like this,

139
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,230
and what's most important is that I need to ask what to do about lunch!

140
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,430
But your attire is too distinctive...

141
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,600
Then, what should I do?

142
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,270
Umm...

143
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,300
If we go to that place, then maybe...

144
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,190
I know it's weird for me to be saying this,

145
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,660
but she's the type that gets into trouble quite easily.

146
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,460
It stretches well, and it's a fabric that gets cleaned very easily.

147
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,540
Wow!

148
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,170
This is what they call "high tech" right?

149
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,290
Damn you, stupid Sister!

150
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,210
Hey Index!

151
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,690
What the hell are you doing in a place like... this...

152
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,680
Sorry, wrong room-

153
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,850
Touma!!!

154
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,570
It's just the opening ceremony today, so I would've been home by noon.

155
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,910
How would I know that?!

156
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,120
This is common sense.

157
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,150
Then, Touma, did you know this?

158
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,510
The direction and standing position of the caster in the formula used...

159
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,340
...during the idol creation ritual of injecting telesma into crucifixes made in England?

160
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,130
Get it wrong just by a little, and it won't function at all.

161
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,490
Do you know that golden ratio, huh?

162
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:03,210
See, see, this is common sense, eh~

163
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,360
So, Index, who is she?

164
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:09,770
I'm not sure, but she's my friend.

165
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,300
You're not sure?

166
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,650
I'm not sure, but Hyouka's my friend!

167
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,490
My name is Kazakiri Hyouka.

168
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm Kamijyo Touma.

169
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,860
Are you a transfer student?

170
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,740
Y-Yes-

171
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,690
Touma!

172
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,940
Don't be scaring Hyouka here!

173
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,120
Don't worry, Hyouka.

174
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,590
Touma's hot-blooded and indecisive,

175
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,890
and if it involves girls, he's the type that'll dive right into problems for her,

176
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,920
but, he's a good person.

177
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,430
Here, I'll let you hold onto Sphinx.

178
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,090
You could relieve your nervousness by touching a cat, maybe.

179
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:44,530
Is Sphinx... his name?

180
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,620
What's the matter?

181
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,200
Animals are much more cunning than humans,

182
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,220
so he could probably tell the difference between you and me.

183
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,030
Kamijyo-chan!

184
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,400
You sure got some guts already on the first day of second semester!

185
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,960
Huh, Sensei, shouldn't you be at the ceremony...

186
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:22,380
Sensei didn't see you at the hall, so she got worried and came looking for you!!!

187
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,170
Yet, Kamijyo-chan, you-

188
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,440
No, umm, I-

189
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,660
Why is it that girls always trickle down to you wherever you are, Kamijyo-chan?!

190
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,560
Do you possess a weird kind of AIM dispersion field?

191
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,190
What the...

192
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,040
Why don't you say something, too, Kazakiri-

193
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,740
Huh?

194
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,460
She had enough and left?

195
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,870
Umm...

196
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,200
Hyouka.

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,590
It was wild back there, huh?

198
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,070
I was a bit shocked.

199
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,840
Komoe isn't mad or anything.

200
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,860
You don't have to worry about it too much.

201
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,010
You seem to have some sadness about you.

202
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,330
Touma was mad at me.

203
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,960
He didn't hear anything I said.

204
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,820
He didn't smile at all.

205
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,740
Has Touma started to dislike me?

206
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,500
Friends that are able to fight with each other are the ones that are really close.

207
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,340
Why?

208
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,630
The fact they can fight means they can forgive each other properly afterwards.

209
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,000
It's like you can trust that person to not cut off the relationship even after a fight.

210
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,260
Really?

211
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,060
He's a person who would get angry over something for your sake,

212
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,830
so it'll be fine.

213
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,000
Although he's also a person who would come talk to you calmly even after seeing you naked...

214
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,320
Hey.

215
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,630
Touma!

216
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,650
Let's go eat.

217
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,910
We're not eating at home today?

218
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:10,960
We're going out after we eat anyway.

219
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,580
Would you mind joining us, Kazakiri?

220
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,270
Yes, join us, Hyouka!

221
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,220
Is that okay?

222
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,390
Let's go, let's go!

223
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,030
Thank you!

224
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,330
Let me go withdraw some cash.

225
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,640
Himegami.

226
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,440
I transfer here, and now you give me this cold reaction?

227
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,700
I'm a girl who goes unnoticed after all, huh?

228
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,090
Ah, no... right!

229
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,440
We're going to hang out somewhere, won't you join us?

230
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,870
...stupid Komoe...

231
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,040
Nothing.

232
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,660
I was asked to run an errand, so I can't go.

233
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,060
That aside, who is she?

234
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,150
Kazakiri Hyouka, I think.

235
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,730
You're sure she's Kazakiri Hyouka, right?

236
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:15,820
Yeah, Index said so, and she said her name, as well.

237
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,800
You know her?

238
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,580
Kirigaoka Girls' School.

239
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:23,050
The high school I attended before.

240
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,770
I saw Kazakiri Hyouka's name there too.

241
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,110
Then is she a user of a rare kind of power like you?

242
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,600
I don't know.

243
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,780
Her name always showed up
on the top rankings of test results,

244
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,920
but no one ever saw her in person.

245
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,520
No one even knew which class she was in.

246
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,960
What's up with that?

247
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,140
That's when I got curious and investigated a little.

248
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,580
It was then that I found out.

249
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,640
She's called "Counter Stop".

250
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,180
However, that's not the important part.

251
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,600
Kazakiri Hyouka has been called the key to understanding the Imaginary Number Sector - Five Elements Institution.

252
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,680
The Five Elements Institution?

253
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,060
That thing really exists?

254
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,110
Rumor has it this Institution is the one that controls the administration of Academy City from the shadows.

255
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,110
A special research facility was established just for researching her ability.

256
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:20,660
So, it is a research center dedicated to discovering the truth of the Imaginary Number Sector - Five Elements Institution.

257
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,500
What is a person like her doing here?

258
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,970
She said she is a transfer student.

259
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,510
I should be the only transfer student.

260
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,220
Be careful.

261
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,270
This must be...

262
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,420
...the famous "Underworld"!

263
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,470
You mean, underground mall.

264
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,150
Underground mall.

265
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,660
Index, is there something you'd like to eat?

266
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:53,690
Expensive places and places with long lines
are out of the question!

267
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,870
I want somewhere cheap, abundant in amount, delicious in quality, and not too popular!

268
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,230
Yeah, yeah.

269
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,150
What about you, Kazakiri?

270
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,630
Did I do something wrong?

271
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,740
No.

272
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,290
I'm not scared or anything...

273
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,510
You've seen my body already...

274
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,970
No!

275
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:25,100
Secret tea time with an outsider girl, eh?

276
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:29,720
If only the elite kids in my class would pull something reckless like that, too...

277
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,750
Gosh, you Anti-Skills have a problem here!

278
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:37,450
What if this outsider were a dangerous person!

279
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,160
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,250
So, I heard there were two of these outsiders.

281
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,670
I wanted to confirm one thing really badly with you.

282
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,930
Were there really... two of them?

283
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,100
Yes, Yomikawa speaking.

284
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:01,200
I'm on my way.

285
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,180
Anti-skill work?

286
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,020
Looks like we got a big one.

287
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,200
I'll be out for a bit.

288
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,550
See ya~

289
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,270
I brought you the book you asked for.

290
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,740
Thank you, Himegami-chan.

291
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,160
Komoe-sensei.

292
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,950
Yes?

293
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,380
Is there a student called Kazakiri Hyouka at this school?

294
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,470
There she is.

295
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,580
It's an evacuation order!!

296
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,760
I'd prefer if you wouldn't move at all.

297
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,630
I serve in the law enforcement unit of this city,

298
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,110
Shirai Kuroko of Judgment.

299
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,120
I'm sure you don't need us to tell you the reason we're going to arrest you.

300
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,900
Search halted.

301
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,430
Giving me extra work...

302
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,630
I said not to move.

303
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,640
Don't understand Japanese?

304
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,360
What is this?!

305
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,650
Impossible!

306
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,410
A normal human who's also an esper?

307
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,910
This is not good!

308
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,100
I have to retreat-

309
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,740
I'm not sure what this fuss is about...

310
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,800
...but don't be touching my friends, damn it!!!

311
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,040
It's okay now.

312
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,610
That huge hand was just a diversion.

313
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:19,620
The fact that you're after this person means...

314
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:23,830
Yes, it was apparently an intruder.

315
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,250
Oneesama!!!

316
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:26,820
Hey!

317
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,790
Geez...

318
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:34,500
Kuroko, it's okay to rely on me more.

319
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,040
Don't think about not causing me trouble.

320
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,460
This is such a rare chance!

321
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,230
Being this close, I can enjoy Oneesama's cleavage as much as I want...

322
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,020
Hold it, Kuroko, that's not what I meant...

323
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,810
Widespread even before the era before Noah's Ark,

324
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,070
using bits of knowledge passed on by the chief of the Grigoris,

325
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,610
now, in a method different from the original...

326
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,320
"In the beginning, there was primal clay."

327
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:11,540
"God created a form from the clay,
bestowed life upon it, and called it 'Man'."

328
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,960
"This secret was passed to Man through the oral tradition of the fallen angels."

329
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,960
"However, this was a secret too great for Man to handle."

330
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:27,600
"Thus, the life borne from my hand halts at a decaying mud doll."

331
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,470
Mud-stinking golem, Ellis.

332
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:33,300
Laugh and decay at my bidding.

333
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:51,940
Don't make me wait too long, Ellis.

334
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,760
The monster that Shelley Cromwell controls, Ellis.

335
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,550
Being stuck in the underground mall,

336
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,050
we get caught in an intensive battle.

337
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,680
Kazakiri, what's your secret?!

338
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,750
Next time, "Golem".

339
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,770
When science and magic cross paths,

340
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,060
this epic will begin!
