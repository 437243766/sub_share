1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,830
The mysterious transfer student, Kazakiri Hyouka, is not human.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,210
She was a physical phenomenon,
born from all AIM dispersion fields.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,820
But... so what?

4
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,880
She's... our friend!

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,580
Don't cry now, monster.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,620
It's rather disgusting for you to be crying anyway!

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,730
Kept you waiting there, eh?

8
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,140
It's okay now.

9
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,630
God, don't be silly.

10
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,470
Quit crying over something stupid like this.

11
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,290
Ellis!

12
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,670
Rejoice, monster.

13
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,130
This world is rather interesting after all...

14
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,260
...since there's always some idiot like him...

15
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,310
I'm not alone.

16
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,880
W-Why...

17
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,350
Come on...

18
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,530
Who needs a reason?

19
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,280
I just said one thing to them.

20
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,920
"Please save my friend."

21
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,580
Let me show you now...

22
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,210
...that in this world you reside in...

23
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,200
...there's still hope!

24
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,380
And I'll show you...

25
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,920
...that your illusion...

26
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,140
...won't break down because of small things like this!!!

27
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,380
Ellis, trample! All of them!

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,980
Formation B, protection of the civilians is our top priority!

29
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,340
Fire!

30
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,590
Michael!

31
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,050
Raphael!

32
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,600
Gabriel!

33
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,500
Uriel!

34
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,130
The four head angels that symbolize the four skies!

35
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,750
Direct the right power in the right direction...

36
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,260
...and guide it to the right position!

37
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,270
Just as expected up to this point.

38
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,690
I don't like the fact that it's as bad as I'd expected...

39
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,920
Kid, are you really going to do this?

40
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,180
No one will blame if you chicken out.

41
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,650
You just saw it, right?

42
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,750
The power of my right hand?

43
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:17,170
It's probably more like "I have to do this".

44
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,810
Wait... Please wait!

45
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,200
Do... Do what?

46
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,100
Isn't it obvious?

47
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,250
I'm going to go stop that monster!

48
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,040
Acting tough, eh?

49
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:35,150
Tsukuyomi-sensei is blessed with good students after all.

50
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,690
Preparation!

51
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,650
Count five!

52
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,860
Count three!

53
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,580
Don't!

54
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,440
You'll never make it!

55
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,970
I don't want that to happen!

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,430
I-

57
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,840
Don't stop me, Kazakiri.

58
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,600
My right hand will blow away all types of supernatural power.

59
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,260
It'll neutralize all types of power.

60
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,270
I'm sure you're no exception.

61
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,180
Count one!

62
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,240
Just because we can't touch each other...

63
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,850
...doesn't mean I'm not your friend anymore...

64
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,390
I'll be back.

65
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,350
You hear me? I will.

66
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,990
...be back...

67
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,490
That's right.

68
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,530
We'll get Index again and go have fun somewhere, the three of us.

69
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,990
Count zero!

70
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,380
Ellis!

71
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,720
FIRE!!!

72
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,550
Now then...

73
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,410
What are you trying to do?

74
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,880
You won't be able to get out of this either.

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,080
I don't need to.

76
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,640
I said, I don't need to!

77
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,710
You shut up and take a nap!!!

78
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,380
Now I just need to-

79
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,060
You're going to create a second one?

80
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:46,510
I can't sustain two of them at once.

81
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,810
But...

82
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,320
...if I make use of that idea, I can do things like this!

83
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,400
Cease fire!

84
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,120
Damn it.

85
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,690
She got away?

86
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,320
What's the meaning of this?

87
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,120
Her target was right in front of her, yet she just ran away like that...

88
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Think.

89
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,380
Am I missing anything?

90
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,780
English Purist Church?!

91
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,680
Why is someone from the same organization as Index...

92
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,330
I want war.

93
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,430
And I want to create the reason.

94
00:08:55,430 --> 00:09:00,290
That's why the more people that know I'm from the English Purist Church, the better!!!

95
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,850
What was the name of that kid again?

96
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,630
Well, the one I need to kill doesn't have to be her.

97
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,070
Killing you would be the same!

98
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,530
Index?!

99
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,960
It's so hot...

100
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,550
Yeah.

101
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,740
But what's with your clothes anyway?

102
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,480
Wearing that much when it's hot as balls...

103
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,180
It doesn't bother me.

104
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,880
Right now, the wind is blowing and it feels good.

105
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:38,570
Holy-

106
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,740
You're just holding it together with safety pins?!

107
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,940
How did it end up so messed up?

108
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,820
That brings up some old scars,

109
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,860
so please don't pursue this issue any further...

110
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,580
But they sure are slow.

111
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,410
It seemed that magician was targeting Hyouka,

112
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:10,670
and her spells had the indications of the London style.

113
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,150
I really hope nothing happens.

114
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,800
Is Hyouka the other girl that was with us?

115
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,370
Yeah.

116
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,120
Ah, Touma wasn't the one who grabbed the girl this time.

117
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,850
I met her first.

118
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,260
"This time"... eh?

119
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,340
Maybe worried... Maybe worried...

120
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,130
I am worried that a girl is left behind in a place like that,

121
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:41,130
but I'm also worried about leaving Touma with a girl in a dark place like that...

122
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,730
Who cares about this?

123
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,580
Are you not worried about him at all?

124
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,700
Touma?

125
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,990
I'm not.

126
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,780
Touma will come back no matter what happens.

127
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,080
Come back? Whatever.

128
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,920
Wait, is this girl his-

129
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,590
Hold it, Sphinx!

130
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,880
Sure.

131
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,680
I'll stay around here, so go grab the cat and hurry back.

132
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,150
My body's the kind that cats despise,
so there's no point in me chasing her.

133
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,150
Sorry!

134
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,110
I may be somewhat thankful for you doing this!

135
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,110
Sphinx!

136
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,890
Come on, wait!

137
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,840
Why isn't the seal on the underground mall being lifted?

138
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,940
Administration of the underground mall is out of our jurisdiction.

139
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,100
They're saying it'll take a little longer before the seal is lifted.

140
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,190
Damn it!

141
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,740
U-Umm...

142
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,850
Thank you very much for what you did.

143
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,810
Sure thing.

144
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:05,370
Are you okay though?

145
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,630
Y-Yes.

146
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,610
I think I'm okay.

147
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:13,830
That... golem isn't going to attack us anymore, right?

148
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,940
That sneaky lady didn't escape.

149
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,630
She just started to pursue her next target.

150
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,970
Her objective isn't to kill you or me, Kazakiri.

151
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,050
As long as certain conditions were met,
she could've chosen anyone.

152
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,560
Anyone?

153
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,070
Yeah.

154
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,520
And one of those people... is Index...

155
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,990
No!

156
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,290
But couldn't we ask those people to protect her?

157
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,800
Index isn't a civilian of this city.

158
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,990
If Anti-Skill finds her, she might be arrested.

159
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,620
We can't ask them to protect her just like that.

160
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,940
I guess... I just have to go from here...

161
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,540
Damn it.

162
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,750
If only they could open the barricades, I could get there ahead of her easily!

163
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,380
Why do I have to play the second hand?

164
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,310
How am I going to get down there?

165
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,370
W-Wait!

166
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,890
Are you really going to go by yourself?

167
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,210
Index is in danger.

168
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,810
It's... okay...

169
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,210
There's a way to save her... even if you don't go...

170
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,760
What do you mean?

171
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,100
A monster... for a monster... that's all...

172
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,200
I don't believe I can defeat that golem...

173
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,280
...but at the very least, I can serve as a bait...

174
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,700
While I'm getting beaten,

175
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,500
I'll get her to run away.

176
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,130
I'm just a monster...

177
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:10,140
...and that's all I can do...

178
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,290
Why are you still saying things like that?!

179
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,920
You're not a monster!

180
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,360
Besides, you think I'd be happy if you did that for me?!

181
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,610
But that's for the better!

182
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,650
I'm happy being a monster...

183
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:32,040
Since I'm a monster, no matter how many times that golem punched me, I didn't die.

184
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,640
Because I'm a monster, I'm able to stand up to that golem.

185
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,260
I will use my power to protect those I cherish.

186
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,260
That's why I'm fortunate... to be a monster...

187
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,660
Kazaki-

188
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,380
Kazakiri!!!

189
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,500
See?

190
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,550
I'm okay.

191
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,630
Kazakiri... Hyouka?

192
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,900
A place where there's no mass or flow of air,

193
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:18,070
created from the AIM dispersion fields generated by all espers...

194
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,970
The city of shimmers.

195
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:27,680
An invisible place that exists in the same location as Academy City.

196
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,040
I was scared of this city of shimmers.

197
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:38,550
I give someone a role by looking at them.

198
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,010
I destroy someone's life by thinking about them.

199
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,110
I am the spring force in a clockwork.

200
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:54,810
I breathe life into this clockwork of a society,

201
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,680
just the part of the spring in this gimmick.

202
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,840
I can't go to the outside world.

203
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,750
Even if people on the outside see me,

204
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,290
I can't touch or talk to them.

205
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,280
But that was the first time...

206
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,750
...I came to the outside world...

207
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,600
Umm...

208
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,910
I think you need to press the button.

209
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,690
Today marked the first time I spoke,

210
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,610
the first time I wore a gym uniform,

211
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,610
the first time a man saw my body,

212
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,320
the first time I went to a game center,

213
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,670
the second time a man saw my body...

214
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,480
Today was the first time I had friends.

215
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,020
If she knew that I was this monster,

216
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,170
she might not want to be my friend anymore.

217
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,910
But even so... I...

218
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,140
I...

219
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,690
Hold it, Sphinx!

220
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,430
If you don't behave, I may just have to punish you for real!

221
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,840
Look, we're going back to the meeting area.

222
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,490
What's your answer?

223
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,730
The ground... is shaking?

224
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,410
Basic principle is Kabbalah.

225
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,030
Main form of use is defense and elimination of enemies.

226
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,020
Era of extraction is the 16th Century.

227
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,420
Applied nature detected.

228
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,730
Mixing of English Purist Church magic style with original style.

229
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,880
Linguistic system changed from Hebrew to English.

230
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,890
From the structure of the spell, determined golem is not in automaton mode, but manipulated from distance.

231
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,810
Then...

232
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
T T T R - Distort to the left.

233
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:40,280
Just a shadow that strolls the deep seas,

234
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,320
C F A - Alter to above.

235
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,620
Bearing fear, hesitation, and suspicion.

236
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,660
P I O B T L L - Step back with left leg.

237
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,190
Quietly opening its umbrella,

238
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:53,660
This jellyfish who hides its heart.

239
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,080
I can't use any magic.

240
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,130
But I can create confusion in the magic.

241
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,160
Spell intercept.

242
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:01,010
If I can barge into the caster's spell with this forced enchanting-

243
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,850
Pursuing a dream blindly,

244
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,200
Not knowing where you go.

245
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,710
Losing track of the Heavens and Earth,

246
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,640
C R B B F - Alter to the right. Cross both legs.

247
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:19,880
Simply following the path of light.

248
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,560
T T N A T W I T O D - Turn neck and hip opposite directions.

249
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,110
Evading won't be enough!

250
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,290
Reverse-engineering self-regeneration formula.

251
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,240
Period is approximately three seconds.

252
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,300
If I am to put it at a disadvantage...

253
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,000
There!

254
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,390
It may be working.

255
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,350
C R-

256
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,130
M B F P A D C O G - Position legs in parallel and lose balance.

257
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,250
Wishing to be loved

258
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
But scared to love.

259
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,880
This may be bad...

260
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,070
Such a darling,

261
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,680
Long distance manipulation has been switched to automaton mode.

262
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,390
I can't interfere!

263
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,310
Or so you believe.

264
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:36,900
If truth were to transform

265
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,160
Into complete vagueness,

266
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,820
I'd rather not know anything

267
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,390
Touma...

268
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:53,620
And follow the path to where light does not reach.

269
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,630
When there is a difference in agenda, new seeds of conflict are born.

270
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,520
No matter what happens,

271
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,850
we will always be...

272
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,110
Next time, "Imaginary Number Sector - Five Elements Institution".

273
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,270
When science and magic cross paths,

274
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,810
this epic will begin!
