1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,570
I'm happy being a monster...

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,910
Since I'm a monster, no matter how many times that golem punched me, I didn't die.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,410
Because I'm a monster, I'm able to stand up to that golem.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,830
I will use my power to protect those I cherish.

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,800
That's why I'm fortunate... to be a monster...

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,890
Damn it!

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,430
Like I'll let it end this way!

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,260
Kazaki-

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,750
Kazakiri!!!

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,330
Like I'll let it end... in such a stupid way!

11
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,090
If you're looking for Ellis, I had her go ahead of me.

12
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,800
I should think she's reached her target by now.

13
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,760
Or perhaps... the target might already have been shredded to chunks of meat!

14
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,140
You piece of...

15
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,530
That's perfect.

16
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,020
You just stay here and be my opponent.

17
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,740
Unfortunately that girl got by.

18
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,860
Kazakiri?!

19
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
It appeared you were able to destroy Ellis.

20
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,280
I want war.

21
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,620
What the hell are you thinking?

22
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,040
There's still a balance between
magic and science, isn't there?

23
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,280
Yet, why?

24
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,650
When espers use magic, their body will be destroyed.

25
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,340
You've heard of that at least?

26
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,050
What?

27
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,720
Didn't you think that was weird?

28
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,170
How would anyone know about that?

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,140
Because someone tried to, around twenty years ago,

30
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,250
back when there was a movement to have magic and science walk together,

31
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,390
which was started by one of our inner factions.

32
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,370
They were trying to give birth to a new type of caster that possessed both esper abilities and magic.

33
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,240
The result was...

34
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:46,420
Ellis was my friend.

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,080
Ellis was one of the espers brought in by the faction in Academy City.

36
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,340
Thanks to the spells I taught her,

37
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,050
Ellis ended up spilling all her blood.

38
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,750
To save me from the Knights that came to destroy our facility,

39
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,660
Ellis was beaten to death by their maces.

40
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,350
We cannot co-exist!

41
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,440
Magicians in the world of magic!

42
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,240
Scientists in the world of science!

43
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,980
If we don't know the boundaries of our own fields properly, the same mistakes will be repeated over and over again!

44
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,270
Damn it, this is not making any sense!

45
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,490
If this is about protecting each other,
what the hell is starting a war going to do?

46
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,290
Wait, you're not actually going to start one.

47
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,740
If you're going to accomplish what you want,
you just want a situation where they're about to go to war.

48
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,210
Don't look at me so highly, kid.

49
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,680
How dare you look at me with pity!

50
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,850
The clay is my ally.

51
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,720
And in this abyss surrounded by clay, I am the ruler!

52
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,400
Don't tell me... she's going to destroy the entire tunnel?!

53
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,850
Everything, crumble down!

54
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,310
Like a puppet of mud!

55
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,780
Shit, what should I do?!

56
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,320
Then, Touma, did you know this?

57
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,470
The direction and standing position of the caster in the formula used...

58
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,360
Get it wrong just by a little, and it won't function at all.

59
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Do you know that golden ratio, huh?

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,620
I see!

61
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,080
Devour the foolish ones!

62
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,040
Melt them into the mud!

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,000
The magic seals on the walls and ceiling are used to bury me alive.

64
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,960
And I will recompose your body with all this mud!

65
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,390
Then, she didn't need to have seals on the ground, too!

66
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,310
That must mean these seals are the ones that protect her!

67
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,730
What?!

68
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,150
It stopped-

69
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,740
Damn it...

70
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,950
Damn...

71
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,250
I need to... create war... the reason for it...

72
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,250
Academy City is letting down its guard too much.

73
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:15,030
Even the Church is letting an outsider have possession of Index Librorum Prohibitorum, showing their naivety.

74
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,620
It was the same situation that occurred during Ellis' time.

75
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,770
A tragedy of that scale took place back then when there were just small factions.

76
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,130
If Academy City and the English Purist Church in their entireties are joining hands-

77
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,310
This is pathetic.

78
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,620
Go ahead and be angry. Be sad.

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,970
But, what the hell did Kazakiri do then?

80
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,210
What did Index do to you?

81
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,620
You point your weapon at someone...

82
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,410
...and that's when real wars happen!

83
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,760
You don't get it.

84
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,230
Damn it!

85
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,680
I want to slaughter all magicians and espers!

86
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,210
But that's not it!

87
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:57,610
I really don't want magicians and espers fighting each other!

88
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,850
My mind was in conflict from the very beginning...

89
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:08,080
I have more than one conviction...
I have as many as the number of stars...

90
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,350
Why didn't you realize...

91
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,900
...that there was only one thing
you believed in from the very beginning?

92
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,080
In the end, you just didn't want to lose your dear friend, right?

93
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,510
In your eyes, did Index look like she didn't want to be with me?

94
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,840
Did we look like we were going to fight unless we were isolated in our own separate worlds?

95
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,170
We are able to live together without doing such things!

96
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,600
So don't take my dear friend away from me either!

97
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,690
Intimus115!!!

98
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,570
Oh, I see.

99
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,530
When she said she has as many convictions as the number of stars...

100
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,160
Die, esper!!!

101
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,830
You understood the one emotion inside you...

102
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,330
...of wanting someone...

103
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,840
...to stop you, huh?!

104
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,800
This may be bad...

105
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,480
Long distance manipulation has been switched to automaton mode.

106
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
I can't interfere!

107
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,550
Ellis...

108
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,560
I can't reach you...

109
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,570
Ellis...

110
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,490
Kazakiri!

111
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,530
Index!

112
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,160
Touma...

113
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,390
Hyouka?!

114
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,740
Hyou... ka...

115
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,150
Run.

116
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,270
Hurry and run!

117
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,530
It's still dangerous here.

118
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,830
The golem went berserk.

119
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,390
It might be losing control of its regeneration ability.

120
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,230
Hyouka, let's run!

121
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,550
You hurry and run.

122
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,670
What do you mean, "you"?

123
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,480
What about you, Hyouka?

124
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,240
I need to stop that monster.

125
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,520
You can't!

126
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,890
You can't think that you can fight a monster like that!

127
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,900
If you do that, you'll die for sure, Hyouka!

128
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,470
Don't worry.

129
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,710
I'm not human either.

130
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,840
Sorry... for not telling you all this time...

131
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,970
Hyouka!!!

132
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:46,580
The ones to fight monsters... must also be monsters!

133
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,620
I can't go back there anymore.

134
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,820
That "time" will never happen again!

135
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,630
Even so...

136
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,930
Even so, I can't abandon her!!!

137
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,890
Hyouka!!!

138
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,060
Because... she's my friend!!!

139
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,570
Kazakiri!!!

140
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,650
Touma!

141
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,090
I told you...

142
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,400
...that there's still hope in the world you reside in...

143
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,950
...and that I'd show you that!!!

144
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,040
It's over...

145
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,510
...and so is the nice illusion...

146
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,360
Wow, it's so messy here.

147
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,300
What is all this?

148
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,460
Don't tell me this is your doing, too.

149
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,520
You know, while this does happen all the time,

150
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,190
how much trouble do you have to get yourself into?

151
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,410
What's wrong?

152
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,590
My, Oneesama!!!

153
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,800
There you are-

154
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:36,280
Don't tell me... Oneesama, you...

155
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,110
No, I didn't!

156
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,930
In the very near future,
Judgment and Anti-Skill will come after you.

157
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,530
Before this gets bad, let's run away.

158
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,330
Wait, I said this wasn't-

159
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,310
I knew from the very beginning.

160
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,380
Everyone knew, didn't they?

161
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,010
When a monster reveals its true nature, they know what happens next.

162
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,850
I didn't want this.

163
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,830
But what could I do?

164
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,740
A friend...

165
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,570
A person who called me a friend for the first time in my life...

166
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,310
I wanted to save her...

167
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,130
Why must I lose this?

168
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:51,450
Why must I be afraid?

169
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,940
I...

170
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,940
I just didn't want my dear friend to get hurt!!!

171
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,900
That's why I stood up!

172
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,480
I wanted to be with her forever!

173
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,580
I knew that I could be good friends with her!

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,920
But... it was impossible...

175
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,340
...even if she became scared of me... hated me...

176
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,930
...I couldn't watch her get killed!!

177
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,670
Do you feel pain?

178
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,660
Do you feel sad?

179
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,600
If you do, then you're not a monster, okay?

180
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,860
I know this sounds corny, but you're human.

181
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,570
I guarantee that.

182
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Also...

183
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:56,470
Your illusion isn't over yet.

184
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,830
That's...

185
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,360
Why...

186
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,890
Isn't this weird?

187
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,120
I'm... not human...

188
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:29,630
...yet why is she looking at me... as a friend...

189
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,690
Yeah, maybe your composition is a bit different from a human's,

190
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,080
and you might be able to do things other people can't...

191
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,910
Hyouka!

192
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,780
But, it doesn't change the fact that you're Index's friend, right?

193
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,220
You happy now?

194
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,940
Now you're another step closer to the completion of a key...

195
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,610
...that can control the Imaginary Number Sector - Five Elements Institution.

196
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,480
To be honest, you're a monster to me.

197
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:15,320
To think that the Imaginary Number Sector's true nature is the AIM dispersion field itself...

198
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,080
I'm sure no one would think of that.

199
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,140
Then, to be adding self-consciousness to and helping the materialization of something like that,

200
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:23,970
I don't think you to be sane at all.

201
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,990
What are you thinking, Aleister?

202
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,220
Wait.

203
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,570
The Imaginary Number Sector is a kind of aggregation of power that exists in a separate dimension from humans.

204
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,690
An organism born from that aggregation is...

205
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,990
I know what that is...

206
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,490
An angel!

207
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:51,480
If the inhabitants of the Imaginary Number Sector,
like Kazakiri, were "Angels" per se,

208
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,350
then the city in which they live in would be... in other words...

209
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:00,450
Don't tell me you're trying to artificially create Heaven?!

210
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,670
Throwing words like "Angels" and "Heaven" at me...

211
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,380
Cut me some slack.

212
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,500
As if there'd be someone who'd know more than you,

213
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,460
Aleister Crowley, the magician!

214
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,780
From this time's incident,
the world has slowly begun to tremble.

215
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:25,170
You purposely lured in a member of the English Purist Church and defeated her.

216
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,670
What you're thinking is completely beyond me.

217
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:36,200
But if you're going to take advantage of that Imagine Breaker, then be prepared.

218
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,740
Face him with half-assed beliefs,
and his right hand will eat your illusions alive.

219
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,470
The illusions I believed in... are already in a destroyed state since long ago...

220
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,820
Look!

221
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,410
This time, I'm completely unscratched!

222
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,260
Damn, I'm good!

223
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,520
This is a sign that I'm learning, right?

224
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,470
Right?

225
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,810
Kamijyo-chan!

226
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:13,360
You really, really, really LOVE causing trouble for others, don't you?!

227
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,610
Gosh, for you to be in Anti-Skill's custody...

228
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:23,520
That's why I told you to be careful of Kazakiri Hyouka.

229
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:31,490
Your personality of going all out when it comes to women needs a good amount of tweaking sometime.

230
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,580
Umm, these two people in the back scare me,
so could I stay in the hospital?

231
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,130
In absolute-rest, no-visitor conditions-

232
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,380
U-Umm...

233
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,720
Your skirt...

234
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,060
You're not going to fix it?

235
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,590
Is it that weird?

236
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:52,130
I think so...

237
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,420
I really think so...

238
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,240
It was already weird to begin with.

239
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,630
It might be even weirder now.

240
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,030
Already?

241
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,080
Hyouka, you-

242
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,130
Yeah.

243
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,790
My body is like a lump of esper power.

244
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,890
No matter what I do, it'll never change the fact that I'm an unstable entity.

245
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:23,750
Is this because of Touma's right hand?

246
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,750
No.

247
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,430
If his powers really affected me,
then I would've been gone already.

248
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,960
Ah, right, right.

249
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,890
About his power, I don't know too much about it myself.

250
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,940
Esper abilities, alone, aren't enough to explain it.

251
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,420
Now then.

252
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Hyouka?

253
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,670
I need to go back now.

254
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,510
Hyouka!

255
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,540
Don't you worry, I'll be all right.

256
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,640
My body is formed from the powers of many, many people.

257
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,340
Even if I did disappear, it wouldn't mean I'd died.

258
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:24,100
It'd just mean you wouldn't be able to see me.

259
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,500
Even if you can't tell,

260
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,000
I will always be by your side.

261
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,900
Hyouka...

262
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,550
We'll hang out together again, right?

263
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,530
Of course!

264
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:56,560
Like I said, second semester is very busy.

265
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,440
But I have so much time, I'm bored!

266
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,900
Touma wouldn't pay attention to me or play with me!

267
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,110
Look, this is what magicians should look like.

268
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,490
Moe, right? Moe, right?!

269
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,270
Come on, Hime-yan, you do it, too!

270
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,160
Is this... moe then?

271
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,330
Okay, boys and girls, we're going start homeroom.

272
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:21,300
Oh?

273
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,130
Where's Tsuchimikado-chan?

274
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,600
Yeah, I started my job already.

275
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,870
Take care of those two, eh?

276
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,560
Yes, please.

277
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,620
Oh, my!

278
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,040
My ribbon has drifted into...

279
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,960
...Oneesama's forbidden sanctuary!!!

280
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,390
KUROKO!!!

281
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,440
A situation has arisen where we need
the Index Librorum Prohibitorum's assistance.

282
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,850
Have her keeper come, as well.

283
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,820
"Keeper", eh?

284
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,560
Understood.

285
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,490
Kanzaki and I will leave for Japan right away.

286
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,450
The problem, however, is we cannot contact Kanzaki.

287
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,950
What do you mean, Archbishop?

288
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,750
I am wearing a rather dull attire for a change,

289
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,130
you shan't address me by my formal title.

290
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,930
Laura Stuart.

291
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,210
You shall address me by that name.

292
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,600
Sign: Daihasei Festival - the strongest in Academy City

293
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,770
Umm, Index-san?

294
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,530
Touma, you forgot the fridge was empty, didn't you?

295
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,510
Touma, eating something delicious all by yourself...

296
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,910
N-No, this is leftover from lunch...

297
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,140
Touma, you're the only one who even had a lunch, right?!

298
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:27,840
I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry!!!

299
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,150
Such misfortune!!!

300
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:39,100
