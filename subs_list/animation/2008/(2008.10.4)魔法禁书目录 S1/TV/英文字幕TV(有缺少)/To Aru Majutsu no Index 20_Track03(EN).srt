1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,640
The encounter between Accelerator and MISAKA-20001 took place.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,230
A researcher known as Amai Ao had inputted malcode into her head.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,130
If this is activated, 10,000 of the Sisters will begin indiscriminate attacks on all people.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,950
What will you do, Accelerator?

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,280
What... I get no scenes this week either?!

6
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,390
I used to possess a human-like name before, too.

7
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,900
My last name had two kanji characters.

8
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,860
My first name had three.

9
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,210
It wasn't a very special name either.

10
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,190
Pathetic.

11
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:54,020
The virus activation time we found out was tonight, September 1st, 12:00 am.

12
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,010
If the virus is activated,

13
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,040
all Sisters will be infected through
the MISAKA network and will go berserk.

14
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,180
At that point, no one can stop them anymore.

15
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,040
Huh? A man in a white coat?

16
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:10,220
Y-Yes.

17
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,630
He said he was a relative of the little girl,
so we turned her over to him...

18
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
Umm, is there something wrong?

19
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,390
Definitely.

20
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,180
What?

21
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,240
Hey, this virus, if we leave it alone,
it'll activate by itself, right?

22
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,330
Then why is he after the kid?

23
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,410
That's something I don't know either.

24
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,620
Don't you think he's already on the outside?

25
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,240
There are plenty of organizations that would offer him asylum.

26
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,000
Apparently, someone penetrated security from the outside and snuck into Academy City.

27
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,570
The security code in the city was changed to orange during the day.

28
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,750
Now, it's raised to red.

29
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,250
The flow of traffic into and out of
Academy City has been completely frozen.

30
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,220
Amai should still be inside the city.

31
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,330
Wouldn't he be hiding at a friend's place?

32
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,460
I wonder if there's anyone he would've called "friend".

33
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,190
Good point; he's a scumbag like me.

34
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,390
Following the shutdown of the research facility, he has taken on a large amount of costs.

35
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,110
The end of the money trail means the end of the acquaintance trail.

36
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,940
So, he's still lurking somewhere inside this city, eh?

37
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,380
The second humans lose their comfort zone, the more simplistic their actions become.

38
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,090
Just wait a minute.

39
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,710
Don't tell me-

40
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,870
Damn it!

41
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,540
At this rate...

42
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,910
Just a bit more...

43
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,750
Stay with me until the virus is activated!

44
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,920
Now, then...

45
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,380
How should I play with you?

46
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,300
Chill, pops.

47
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,470
You look ridiculous.

48
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,150
Yoshikawa?

49
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,620
Yeah, I've secured the kid.

50
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,270
Hey, there's some electrodes stuck on the damn kid's head.

51
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,880
It's probably an examination kit for the Sisters' experimental bodies.

52
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,770
What's this B.C. operating rate?

53
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,760
Brain cell operating rate.

54
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,700
B.C. obviously stands for Brain Cell.

55
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,760
The operating rate of brain cells?

56
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,940
Hey, can't we neutralize the virus with this equipment?

57
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,630
It'll take quite a while to bring her back to you from here.

58
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,590
That's out of the question.

59
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,890
To overwrite the virus, we'll need a specialized incubation tank and a Testament machine.

60
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,010
Hey.

61
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,890
You...

62
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:04,150
Yes, I'm headed right for you in a car.

63
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,210
I thought this would save more time compared to having you go back to the facility.

64
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,050
Are you done analyzing the virus code?

65
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,500
80% of it, I guess.

66
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,160
I'll make it by midnight.

67
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,410
Sheesh.

68
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,670
How much trouble does this brat want to cause me?

69
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,980
MI... SA...

70
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,280
KAisMISA-KAisMISA-KAisMISA-

71
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
KAisMISAKAisMISA-

72
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,430
MISAMISAMISAMISA-

73
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,310
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

74
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,320
Hey, Yoshikawa.

75
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,720
What's happening here?

76
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,800
Stay quiet for a sec.

77
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,780
I knew it.

78
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,600
That's how it is.

79
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,500
What?

80
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,580
What's going on?

81
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,460
The virus code.

82
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:01,080
It's already in activation preparation mode.

83
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,900
Even though there's still four hours until the time limit...

84
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,390
Don't tell me it was dummy information?!

85
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,390
Listen carefully, Accelerator.

86
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,850
It's too early to be lamenting.

87
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,090
You need to be the one to do this.

88
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,650
Wait, there's still a way out of this?

89
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,660
Before the virus is uploaded to the MISAKA network,

90
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,850
the code is currently entering a stage where it's being encoded into a "superior command" all Sisters must follow.

91
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,150
That'll take approximately ten minutes.

92
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,320
You understand where I'm getting at?

93
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,050
There's only one thing you can do.

94
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,870
The disposal of Last Order.

95
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,260
You need to protect this world by killing her!

96
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,820
Piece of shit!

97
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,190
While I may be the "strongest", my power is only good for changing the direction of forces,

98
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,900
and it can only be used for killing people.

99
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,900
The only thing I can think of...

100
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,710
...is to touch the skin to reverse
the flow of blood and bioelectricity-

101
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,920
Wait. What the...

102
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,810
Something's not right.

103
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,500
Think.

104
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,680
Bioelectricity...

105
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,420
Reverse flow...

106
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,150
Within this data stick is this brat's... Last Order's personality file before the virus infection...

107
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,130
Hey, if I can take control of the brain cells,

108
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,320
can't I manipulate this brat's personality files?

109
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,490
What are you t-

110
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,150
Don't tell me-

111
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,410
Are you planning to substitute yourself for a Testament machine?

112
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,270
You can't.

113
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,510
Sure I can...

114
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,150
If I can "deflect",

115
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,790
then further down the line, "manipulation" wouldn't be...

116
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,560
...out of the question...

117
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,880
Even assuming that you could manipulate Last Order's brain,

118
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:18,080
it would be impossible to completely eradicate the virus.

119
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,170
If you fail, not only will the Sisters die,

120
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,270
but many more casualties will take place.

121
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,020
To prevent that from happening,
we have no choice but to give up on Last Order.

122
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,650
Or are you saying you can prepare a vaccine patch?

123
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,030
Hello?

124
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,070
Are you listening?

125
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,630
I can, I tell you.

126
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,820
Who the hell do you think I am?

127
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,830
I'll do a diff with the pre-infection data...

128
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,760
...and just get rid of all that doesn't match!

129
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,250
It's a piece of cake!

130
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,380
Here goes.

131
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,550
Damn you brat...

132
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,560
I'm doing all this for you,

133
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,210
so don't give me a "I can't be saved anymore" joke.

134
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,070
Comparing with pre-infection data...

135
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:21,570
Targeted code count: 357081

136
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,290
If I get rid of all these together with the virus,

137
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,160
then this kid will be restored to her state a week ago.

138
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,290
A state before she met me.

139
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,040
Executing command...

140
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,650
Delete!

141
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,250
Delete.

142
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,260
Delete.

143
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,970
Delete.

144
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,060
Delete-

145
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,390
Code C-I-R-E-B Register M-A-E

146
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,180

147
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,320

00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,280

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,660

150
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,710
What I'm erasing along with the virus, eh?

151
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,540
And so what?

152
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,540
It's better for her to forget it all, right?

153
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,760
Remaining code count: 23891

154
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,580
Ten seconds remaining.

155
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,490
Too easy, I tell you.

156
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,980
Don't... interfere...

157
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,740
You've got to be shitting me.

158
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm processing work on the order of electron microscopes here.

159
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,770
I don't have any computation capacity left to do a deflection.

160
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:44,490
I should just get my hands off of this brat...

161
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,080
...and regain capacity for a deflection...

162
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,930
...then be it a nuclear weapon or anything, I'd be invincible.

163
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
Geez...

164
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,500
I was too naive.

165
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,010
I thought I could save someone...

166
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,500
...and start all over again...

167
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,270
Are you dead?

168
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,820
You're dead, eh?

169
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,590
Why am I still alive?

170
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:38,190
Error.Break_code_No000001_to_No357081.

171
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,690
Due to incorrect processing,
superior command has been aborted.

172
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,550
Transfer has been aborted, Specimen 20001 will restart.

173
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,270
Abort?

174
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,370
Restart?

175
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,270
Did it... fail?

176
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,040
Why...

177
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
I... I see...

178
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,030
You computed a deflection right before the bullet reached your brain!

179
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,250
Right?!?!

180
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,560
What do you think you're doing?

181
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,710
Someone like you trying to be a hero now...

182
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,640
I know.

183
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,440
A scumbag like me, thinking he could save someone at this point...

184
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,750
...how stupid is that...

185
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:37,140
Geez, I'm too naive.

186
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,750
It gives me goosebumps, too.

187
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,130
But, you know?

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,820
This kid's got nothing to do with us, eh?!

189
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,020
I did indeed butcher 10,000 Sisters.

190
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,460
But... that doesn't mean I can let the remaining 10,000 die.

191
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,830
Yeah, I know it's sugarcoated shit.

192
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,800
But it's not.

193
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,350
No matter how much of a scumbag we are...

194
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,500
...no matter how many reasons we come up with...

195
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,860
...it'll never be enough to let them be killed just like that!!!

196
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,690
Deflection's... not working?

197
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,340
In the end... you just don't have the clutch ability to finish off jobs like heroes...

198
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,280
And what can you do?

199
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,930
We scumbags are all the same...

200
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,140
That's all we are...

201
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,520
Yoshikawa...

202
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,490
...Kikyou...

203
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,620
My apologies.

204
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,080
I'm just a naive person in the end.

205
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,790
I'm not kind, but naive.

206
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,900
I don't have the courage to shoot you in a vital area,

207
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,550
yet I didn't feel like letting you go either.

208
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,470
Meaninglessly extending your pain...

209
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,480
...the crueler it is, the more naive a choice it is, perhaps...

210
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,940
Whatever happened here, I could only pick up from the sounds through the phone.

211
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,380
But at least, it didn't seem like any commotion happened outside.

212
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Ah, don't worry about him.

213
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,030
I have a peculiar doctor among my acquaintances.

214
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,810
Just because his face looks like a frog,
he doesn't have a dignified presence, exactly.

215
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,130
People do call him "Heaven Canceller" though.

216
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,340
With his skills, the kid will still live.

217
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,920
Why?!

218
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,710
I don't understand!

219
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,960
With your personality that only weighs every aspect between risk and chance,

220
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,810
this decision of yours doesn't make sense!

221
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:31,160
I... never wanted to become a researcher like I am now...

222
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,550
I wanted to become a school teacher.

223
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,210
Not some strict role like an instructor or professor,

224
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,040
but a kind teacher... was what I wanted to become.

225
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,960
I want to remember each and every face of my students...

226
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,770
...and listen to them when they have problems they want to talk about.

227
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,920
Smiling at them, without asking for anything in return.

228
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:58,370
I want them to make fun of me when I shed tears for them on their graduation day.

229
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,450
That's the kind teacher I wanted to become.

230
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,240
I must still have attachments to that dream.

231
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,940
For once, I wanted to do something kind, not naive.

232
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,410
An act just like a teacher doing everything she can for one child...

233
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,410
I wanted to do an act like that.

234
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,870
It's over, Amai Ao.

235
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,970
You're afraid of dying alone, right?

236
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,990
Then, choose my life to take along with yours.

237
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,340
I will not let you choose a child's life,

238
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,050
and I swear that by the kindness that lives in me just this once in my life.

239
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,570
Kindness doesn't fit you at all.

240
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:49,970
That's just... strength...

241
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,950
I... survived... eh?

242
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,390
Of course.

243
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,420
Who do you think performed the surgery?

244
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:19,700
Although I think my heart was shot at point blank...

245
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:24,510
To be precise, it was actually a coronary artery
extending from the heart.

246
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,900
Either way, you were pretty much dead on the spot.

247
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,940
So if you want to thank someone, thank that kid.

248
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,280
It seems he has the ability to control the flow of blood.

249
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,460
It was as if he had an invisible tube...

250
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,990
...and didn't allow a single drop of blood to spill between the broken ends of your artery.

251
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:54,070
He subconsciously kept using his ability the entire time until you reached the surgery room.

252
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:58,540
This, even when he was walking a fine line himself...

253
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,810
He has some damage to his frontal lobe.

254
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,800
His language ability and computation ability...

255
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,100
...it'll affect these two abilities of his...

256
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,050
Computation ability?

257
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,550
Then, his ability's-

258
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, it's probably fine.

259
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,520
To make something that can't work anymore work again is my policy.

260
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,440
I will help him regain his language and computation abilities.

261
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:28,040
I will.

262
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:31,870
You seemed to have made something pretty complex,

263
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,720
so I'll be using that.

264
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:41,930
Linking 10,000 of those should be more than enough to make up for one person's language and computation abilities.

265
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,900
The MISAKA network?

266
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,140
What about Last Order?

267
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,280
You don't have to worry a thing about that little girl.

268
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,180
I'm taking care of a similar child at home.

269
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,770
Well then, I'll be going.

270
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,110
What are you going to do?

271
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
What am I going to do?

272
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,550
Looks like the higher-ups found out about this incident.

273
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,720
The research facility has been closed.

274
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,280
The experiment has been completely terminated.

275
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,090
In other words, you're fired.

276
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,150
I see...

277
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,250
Then I can't live as a researcher anymore...

278
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,410
There's plenty of other paths!

279
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,420
Hey, please.

280
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,930
Save him.

281
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,410
If you can't, I won't forgive you.

282
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:32,770
Who do you think you are talking to?

283
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,360
That is my battlefield.

284
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,750
And I will return from my battlefield,

285
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,100
bringing back a patient who has been fighting all of his life.

286
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,890
I'm the guy that butchered 10,000 of those Sisters.

287
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,040
And you're asking that bad guy to save who now?

288
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,500
See?

289
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,080
He was able to do it if he tried.

290
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,310
Opening day of second semester.

291
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,270
Shockwaves are sent throughout Academy City,
caused by the magician intruder...

292
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,730
...and a new mysterious transfer student.

293
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,060
"Imaginary Number Sector"? What the hell is that?

294
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,530
Next time, "Counter Stop - Unknown Entity".

295
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,900
When science and magic cross paths,

296
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,470
this epic will begin!
